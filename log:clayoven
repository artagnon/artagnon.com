Minimalism and responsive design

So, I started out with three goals in mind:

1. I want to write like I write emails to the git list.  Markdown is a
   complete overkill, because I don't want so much formatting: I want
   the output HTML to faithfully represent the textual input.  Then
   again, <pre> is barbaric.

2. I'm a programmer who's interested in minimalism and corectness, not
   unnecessary prettification.  Therefore, simple hand-written CSS
   that should render uniformly on all browsers and devices.  I hate
   frameworks and obfuscation (minification?).

3. I want to be as terse as possible, and the software should be an
   absolute pleasure to work with.

Look at the input that went into creating this page [1], view this
site on various browser/devices, and check out clayoven [2].

In the spirit of minimalism, I used precisely two things for fronend
development:

1. A CSS reset to make your CSS browser independent.  Use this [3].

2. A meta viewport tag to make your CSS scale to different device
   widths.  Use meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,
   initial-scale=1.0" for responsive sites.
