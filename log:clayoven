The clayoven problem

> Why yet another static site generator?

When I started building the static site generator for this site, my
philosophy was:

1. I want to write like I write emails to the git list.  Markdown is a
   complete overkill, because I don't want so much formatting: I want
   the output HTML to faithfully represent the textual input.  Then
   again, I don't want to show it verbatim: I can manage to do a
   little line wrapping, to make sure that they're viewable on all
   screen sizes (this involves some CSS).

2. I want it to be an absolute pleasure to work with.  Among other
   things, this means being as terse as possible.

3. I want it to be an absolute pleasure to write.  This means that a
   well-documented, minimally maintained, beautiful codebase.

I'm happy to report that I met all three goals:

1. Look at the input corresponding to this page [1].  View the site on
   your phone to see how the CSS adapts.

2. Look at [2] for the git repository that backs this site: notice how
   titles, sort-order, and nesting (subpages) are automatically
   inferred.  There's even an gitignore-like .clayoven/ignore to
   specify which files to ignore; example: README.md.

3. Ruby, obviously.  It's not an "active" project, but I do patch it
   every once in a while.  The sources are well-documented too [3].
