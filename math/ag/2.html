          We will understand schemes through the sheaf of functions on a space. We define schemes in terms of three pieces of data:
        </p>
        <ol class="olitems" type="a" start="1">
          <li>
            The set: the points of the scheme.
          </li>
          <li>
            The topology: the open sets of the scheme.
          </li>
          <li>
            The structure sheaf: the sheaf of algebraic functions, or a sheaf of rings, on the scheme.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In the key example of affine complex variety (roughly, things cut out in <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}^n$</span> by polynomials), the set is the set of "traditional points" that are n-tuples of complex numbers, plus some handy additional points. For the topology, we will require that the "subset of points where the function vanishes" to be closed. For the structure sheaf, we have algebraic functions on the open space consisting of points where the denominator does not vanish.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a first example, consider differentiable manifolds. Taking <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> to be a differentiable manifold, we see that it has a topology, and a sheaf of differentiable functions <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_X$</span>. This gives <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_X$</span> the structure of a ringed space. Evaluation at a point <span class="mathjax">$p$</span> gives a surjective map from the stalk to <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{R}$</span>:<br/>
          $<span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_{X, p} \twoheadrightarrow \mathbb{R}$</span>$
        </p>
        <p>
          so the kernel, the germs of functions vanishing at <span class="mathjax">$p$</span>, is given by the maximal ideal <span class="mathjax">$m_{X, p}$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We could define a differentiable manifold as a topological space <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> with a sheaf of rings. We would require that there is an open cover of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> by open sets, such that on each open set, the ringed space is isomorphic to a ball around the origin in <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{R}^n$</span>. With this definition, the ball is the basic patch, and the manifold is obtained by gluing patches together. The basic patch gives rise to the notion of an <mark>affine scheme</mark>, which will be discussed shortly. Functions are determined by their values at points, but this won't be true for schemes in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          To discuss differentiable maps between manifolds <span class="mathjax">$\pi : X \rightarrow Y$</span>, we first note that they are continuous maps; differentiable functions pull back to differentiable functions. More formally, we have <span class="mathjax">$\pi^{-1} \mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \mathscr{O}_X$</span>. The inverse image map is left adjoint to the pushforward, so we also get a map <span class="mathjax">$\pi^{\#} : \mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \pi_* \mathscr{O}_X$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certainly, given a differentiable map of differentiable functions, differentiable functions pull back to differentiable functions. This is a sufficient condition for continuous functions to be differentiable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Manifolds are covered by disks that are all isomorphic, but this isn't true for schemes. As an example, consider two "smooth complex varieties", the algebraic equivalent of Riemann spaces, <span class="mathjax">$X, Y$</span> where no nonempty open subset of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> is isomorphic to a nonempty open subset of <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span>. Informally, this is because in Zariski topology all nonempty open subsets are "huge" and have more structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as we have the example of differentiable manifolds in differential geometry, we have the example of continous functions in topology, and complex manifolds with functions holomorphic functions in complex geometry.
        </p>
        <h2 id="underlying-set-of-affine-schemes">
          Underlying set of affine schemes
        </h2>
        <p>
          We will first define <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span> to be the prime spectrum of ring <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>, the set of all prime ideals of <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>. Later, we will endow it with topology, and define a structure sheaf on it, yielding an <mark>affine scheme</mark>. The prime ideal <span class="mathjax">$\mathfrak{p}$</span> of <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>, when considered as an element of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span>, will be denoted by <span class="mathjax">$[\mathfrak{p}]$</span>. Elements <span class="mathjax">$a \in A$</span> will be called <mark>functions on <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span></mark>, and their <mark>value</mark> at point <span class="mathjax">$[\mathfrak{p}]$</span> will be <span class="mathjax">$a\, (\text{mod } \mathfrak{p})$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          An element of the ring lying in a prime ideal <span class="mathjax">$\mathfrak{p}$</span> translates to a function vanishing at point <span class="mathjax">$[\mathfrak{p}]$</span>. If we add or multiply two functions, we add or multiply their values at all points; this is a direct consequence of <span class="mathjax">$A \rightarrow A/\mathfrak{p}$</span> being a ring homomorphism. If <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> is generated over a base field or base ring by elements <span class="mathjax">$x_1, \ldots, x_r$</span>, these elements are called <mark>coordinates</mark>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will interpret functions on <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span> as global sections on the structure sheaf; i.e. a function on a ringed space. The notion of "value of a function" will later be interpreted as values on a particular locally ringed space.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a first example, consider the complex affine line <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^1 := \text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x]$</span>. Since <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}[x]$</span> is an integral domain, <span class="mathjax">$0$</span> is a prime ideal. <span class="mathjax">$(x - a)$</span> is a prime ideal too, and it is maximal, since quotient by this ideal gives a field:
        </p>
        <div class="mathjax">
          $$
          0 \rightarrow (x - a) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}[x] \xrightarrow{f \mapsto f(a)} \mathbb{C} \rightarrow 0
          $$
        </div>
        <p>
          There are no other prime ideals. In the geometric picture, there is one "traditional point" for each <span class="mathjax">$a \in \mathbb{C}$</span> plus one bonus point <span class="mathjax">$[(0)]$</span>. <span class="mathjax">$[(x - a)]$</span> will readily associate to <span class="mathjax">$a \in C$</span>, but <span class="mathjax">$[(0)]$</span> is mysterious, for it lies somewhere on the complex line, but nowhere in particular: we will call it a "generic point".
        </p>
        <p>
          To get some intuition for this space, note that functions of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}[x]$</span> are just polynomials in a single variable. Its value at <span class="mathjax">$[(x - a)]$</span> is <span class="mathjax">$f(a)$</span>; equivalently, we can evalute <span class="mathjax">$f(x) \text{ mod } (x - a)$</span>. Its value at <span class="mathjax">$[(0)]$</span> is simply <span class="mathjax">$f(x)$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="mathjax">$g(x) = (x - 3)^3/(x - 2)$</span> is defined everywhere but at <span class="mathjax">$2$</span>; as we will see later, it is an element of the structure sheaf on the open set <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^1 \backslash \{2\}$</span>. <span class="mathjax">$g(x)$</span> has a triple zero at <span class="mathjax">$x = 3$</span>, and a single pole at <span class="mathjax">$x = 2$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 2: <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_k^1 := \text{Spec } k[x]$</span> over algebraically closed <span class="mathjax">$k$</span> is the <mark>affine line</mark> over <span class="mathjax">$k = \bar{k}$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 3: <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } \mathbb{Z}$</span>, which looks a lot like <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\bar{k}^1$</span>, is a unique factorization domain with prime ideals <span class="mathjax">$(0), (p)$</span>. <span class="mathjax">$27/4$</span> has a double pole at <span class="mathjax">$(2)$</span> and a triple zero at <span class="mathjax">$(3)$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 4: <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } k$</span> where <span class="mathjax">$k$</span> is a field is boring: it a single one point, and has no prime ideals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 5: <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{R}^1 := \text{Spec } \mathbb{R}[x]$</span> is the affine real line. It is a Eucledian domain with prime ideals <span class="mathjax">$(0), (x - a)$</span> for <span class="mathjax">$a \in R$</span>, and <span class="mathjax">$(x^2 + ax + b)$</span> for irreducible quadratics <span class="mathjax">$x^2 + ax + b$</span>. Note that <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{R}[x]/(x - 3) \cong \mathbb{R}$</span>, and <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{R}[x]/(x^2 + 1) \cong \mathbb{C}$</span>. As points, we have the usual real numbers, the generic point <span class="mathjax">$0$</span>, and complex conjugates from the roots of the irreducible quadratic. Consider the function <span class="mathjax">$f(x) = x^3 - 1$</span> on this space. Its value at <span class="mathjax">$[(x - 2)]$</span> is <span class="mathjax">$7$</span>, and <span class="mathjax">$x^3 - 1 = -x - 1\, (\text{mod } x^2 + 1)$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 6: <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{F}_p}^1 := \text{Spec } \mathbb{F}_p[x]$</span> is the affine line over <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{F}_p[x]$</span>. <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{F}_p[x]$</span> is a Eucledian domain with prime ideals <span class="mathjax">$(0)$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$(f(x))$</span>, irreducible polynomials of any degree <span class="mathjax">$f(x) \in \mathbb{F}_p[x]$</span>. Irreducible polynomials correspond to Galios conjugates <span class="mathjax">$\bar{\mathbb{F}}_p$</span>. Note that <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{F}_p[x]$</span> has points <span class="mathjax">$p$</span> in the corresponding <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{F}_p$</span>, but has infinitely many more determined by <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } \mathbb{F}_p[x]$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 7: The affine complex plane <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^2 := \text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x, y]$</span> is not a principal ideal domain. Its prime ideals are <span class="mathjax">$(0), (x - a, y - b), (f(x, y))$</span> with <span class="mathjax">$f(x, y)$</span> irreducible. The points of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^2$</span> are therefore traditional points <span class="mathjax">$a, b$</span> corresponding to <span class="mathjax">$[(x - a, y - b)]$</span>, generic point corresponding to <span class="mathjax">$[(0)]$</span>, plus bonus points: for instance, <span class="mathjax">$[(y^2 - x)]$</span> lies everywhere on <span class="mathjax">$x = y^2$</span>, but nowhere in particular. The prime ideals <span class="mathjax">$(x - a, y - b)$</span> are of dimension <span class="mathjax">$0$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$(f(x))$</span> for irreducible <span class="mathjax">$f(x)$</span> are of dimension <span class="mathjax">$1$</span>, and <span class="mathjax">$(0)$</span> is of dimension <span class="mathjax">$2$</span>. Notice that maximal ideals correspond to the smallest points: in general, containment between two ideals is reversed when considering containment of the corresponding points.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 8: The complex affine <span class="mathjax">$n$</span>-space <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^n := \text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x_0, \ldots, x_n]$</span> has prime ideals <span class="mathjax">$(x - a, y - b, z - c)$</span> when <span class="mathjax">$n = 3$</span> corresponding to traditional points, since the residue ring is the field <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}$</span>. These are the only maximal ideals, by <mark>Hilbert's Nullstellansatz</mark>; it states, in the the weak version, that in <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_k^n := k[x_0, \ldots, x_n]$</span> for <span class="mathjax">$k$</span> an algebraically closed field, the only maximal ideals are <span class="mathjax">$(x_0 - a_0, \ldots, x_n - a_n)$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strong version of the Nullstellansatz states that, for any field <span class="mathjax">$k$</span>, every maximal ideal of <span class="mathjax">$k[x_0, \ldots, x_n]$</span> has as residue field, a finite extension of <span class="mathjax">$k$</span>. In other words, any field extension of <span class="mathjax">$k$</span> finitely generated as a ring is also finitely generated as a module.
        </p>
        <p>
          The maximal ideals of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^3$</span> are prime ideals of dimension <span class="mathjax">$0$</span>. For dimension <span class="mathjax">$2$</span>, take <span class="mathjax">$(f(x, y, z))$</span> for irreducible polynomial <span class="mathjax">$f(x, y, z)$</span>. Prime ideals of dimension <span class="mathjax">$1$</span> are trickier, and cannot be organized in any useful way; take <span class="mathjax">$(x, y)$</span> as an example: <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}[x, y, z]/(x, y) \cong \mathbb{C}[z]$</span>, an integral domain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that points of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}^1$</span> correspond to maximal ideals in ring <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{Q}[x]$</span>, called "closed points", can be interpreted as points of <span class="mathjax">$\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$</span> where Galios conjugates are glued together extends to <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}^n$</span>. For example, <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}^2(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2})$</span> is glued to <span class="mathjax">$(-\sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2})$</span>, but not to <span class="mathjax">$(\sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2})$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two natural ways of getting new rings from old, quotients and localizations, have interpretation in terms of spectra:
        </p>
        <ol class="olitems" type="a" start="1">
          <li>
            Quotients. <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A/I$</span> is a subset of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span>. Prime ideals of <span class="mathjax">$A/I$</span> are in bijective correspondence with prime ideals of <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> containing <span class="mathjax">$I$</span>. Consider the picture of affine complex varieties. Suppose <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> is a finitely generated <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}$</span>-algebra, generated by <span class="mathjax">$x_1, \ldots, x_n$</span> with the relations <span class="mathjax">$f_1(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \ldots = f_r(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$</span>. This gives us an interpretation of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span> as a subset of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^n$</span>, which we think of as "traditional points" along with some "bonus points" not yet fully described. To obtain the traditional points, simply solve <span class="mathjax">$f_1 = \ldots = f_r = 0$</span>. The entire picture carries over, along with the Nullstellansatz, when <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}$</span> is replaced by any algebraically closed field.
          </li>
          <li>
            Localizations. <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } S^{-1}A$</span> is a subset of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span>. There are two important flavors of localization, namely <span class="mathjax">$\{1, f, f^2, \ldots\}^{-1} A$</span> for <span class="mathjax">$f \in A$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$(A \backslash \mathfrak{p})^{-1} A$</span>. If <span class="mathjax">$S = \{1, f, f^2, \ldots\}$</span>, the prime ideals of <span class="mathjax">$S^{-1} A$</span> are just those where <span class="mathjax">$f$</span> does not vanish, and we will call this a <mark>distinguished open set</mark>. For instance, <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}[x, y]_{y - x^2}$</span> is pictured as the affine plane with points on <span class="mathjax">$y = x^2$</span> thrown out; i.e. points <span class="mathjax">$(a, a^2)$</span> for <span class="mathjax">$a \in \mathbb{C}$</span>, by which we mean <span class="mathjax">$[(x - a, y - a^2)]$</span>, as well as a "new kind of point" <span class="mathjax">$[(y - x^2)]$</span>. <span class="mathjax">$A \rightarrow S^{-1} A$</span> is non-injective, and this may lead to some confusion. For instance, take <span class="mathjax">$A = \mathbb{C}[x, y]/(xy)$</span> with <span class="mathjax">$f = x$</span>. We end up with an isomorphism <span class="mathjax">$(\mathbb{C}[x, y]/(xy))_x \xrightarrow{\sim} (\mathbb{C}[x])_x$</span>. For <span class="mathjax">$S = A \backslash \mathfrak{p}$</span>, prime ideals of <span class="mathjax">$S^{-1} A$</span> are just those prime ideals of <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> contained in <span class="mathjax">$\mathfrak{p}$</span>. For example, setting <span class="mathjax">$\mathfrak{p} = (x, y)$</span> in <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}[x, y]$</span>, we get "things" through origin; indeed, the zero-dimensional points <span class="mathjax">$[(x, y)]$</span>, the two-dimensional point <span class="mathjax">$[(0)]$</span>, and the one-dimensional points <span class="mathjax">$f$</span> for which <span class="mathjax">$f(0, 0) = 0$</span>; i.e. irreducible curves through origin. As an important example, consider <span class="mathjax">$A = k[x]$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$\mathfrak{p} = (x)$</span>, or any maximal ideal. Then <span class="mathjax">$A_\mathfrak{p}$</span> is the germ of a "smooth curve" where one point is a "classical point", and another is a "generic point" of the curve. This is an example of a <mark>discrete valuation ring</mark>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Therefore, maps of rings induce maps of spectra.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an algebraically closed affine variety, the translation between maps given by explicit functions and maps of rings is quite direct. For example, consider the parabola in <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}^2$</span> given by <span class="mathjax">$b = a^2$</span> and the parabola in <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}^3$</span> given by <span class="mathjax">$y = x^2, z = y^2$</span>. Suppose that the map sends the point <span class="mathjax">$(a, b) \in \mathbb{C}^2$</span> to the point <span class="mathjax">$(a, b, b^2) \in \mathbb{C}^3$</span>. In our new language, we have the map:

        <div class="mathjax">
          $$
          \text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[a, b]/(b - a^2) \rightarrow \text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x, y, z]/(y - x^2, z - y^2)

          Now, we turn our attention to functions not determined by their values at points: the failure of nilpotents. A non-zero function may vanish at all points. Any function whose power is zero necessarily lies in the intersection of all prime ideals. The <a href="/ac/1#nilradicals">nilradical</a> <span class="mathjax">$\mathfrak{N}$</span> is the intersection of all prime ideals. To specify exactly when our intuition fails, two functions have the same value at two different points iff they differ by a nilpotent. Geometrically, a function vanishes at all points in a ring spectrum iff a power of it is <span class="mathjax">$0$</span>. A ring with no nonzero nilpotents is termed <mark>reduced</mark>.

          We will understand rings as geometric objects through the <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec}$</span> functor: it will require us to define the underlying topology of schemes first. In a classical topology, we have visualized "traditional points" in an algebraically closed field as points of the scheme, but "generic points" and non-reduced behavior gives us some trouble; in fields that are not algebraically closed, traditional points are glued together by Galios conjugation. This is the geometric interpretation of Hilbert's Nullstellansatz.
        </p>
        <p>
          The non-traditional points in the picture correspond to "closed" "irreducible" algebraic subsets. Each closed irreducible subset has a generic point sitting in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have also seen how points of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A/I$</span> should be visualized as subsets of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span>; <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x, y]/(x + y)$</span> should be interpreted as a line in the <span class="mathjax">$xy$</span>-plane. Similarly, points of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } S^{-1} A$</span> should be interpreted as subsets of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span>; <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A_f$</span> are the subset of points of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span> where <span class="mathjax">$f$</span> does not vanish: these will be formalized as <mark>distinguished open sets</mark>. If <span class="mathjax">$\mathfrak{p}$</span> is a prime ideal, points of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A_\mathfrak{p}$</span> should be seen as a "shred of the space <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span> near the subset corresponding to <span class="mathjax">$\mathfrak{p}$</span>".

          The locus where a polynomial vanishes should be a closed set. The <mark>Zariski topology</mark> says that the only closed sets we should consider are these sets, and other sets that are forced to be closed by these; in other words, it is the coarsest topology in which the locus where a polynomial vanishes is a closed set.

We also have a bunch of one-dimensional points contained in the <span class="mathjax">$xz$</span> plane.

Moreover, since <span class="mathjax">$(I \cap J)^2 \subset IJ \subset (I \cap J)$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$V(IJ) = V(I \cap J) = V(I) \cup V(J)$</span>.

          A couple of uninteresting examples follow. Consider the Zariski topology on <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^1$</span>: the closed sets correspond to maximal ideals and the generic point <span class="mathjax">$[(0)]$</span>. Open sets are the empty set and points of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^1$</span> minus the maximal ideals. The case of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } \mathbb{Z}$</span> is similar: the open sets are the empty set and all points minus a finite number of <span class="mathjax">$(p)$</span>, where <span class="mathjax">$p$</span> is prime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, consider the Zariski topology on <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^2$</span>. The prime ideals of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}[x, y]$</span>, or the points of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^2$</span> were previously identified to be <span class="mathjax">$[(0)]$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$[(x - a, y - b)]$</span> for <span class="mathjax">$a, b \in \mathbb{C}$</span>, and <span class="mathjax">$(f(x, y))$</span> where <span class="mathjax">$f(x, y)$</span> is an irreducible polynomial. Hence, the closed subsets in its Zariski topology are:

          Maps of rings induce continuous maps on topological spaces. Map <span class="mathjax">$\phi : B \rightarrow A$</span> of rings induces the map <span class="mathjax">$\pi : \text{Spec } A \rightarrow \text{Spec } B$</span> on topological spaces. Not all continuous maps arise in this way; for example, consider <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^1$</span> which is identity, except that points <span class="mathjax">$0$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$1$</span> are swapped: no polynomial can achieve this feat.

          We saw that <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } B/I$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } S^{-1} B$</span> were subsets of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } B$</span>. The Zariski topology behaves well with respect to these inclusions. In particular, if <span class="mathjax">$I \subset \mathfrak{N}$</span> is an ideal of nilpotents, then <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } B/I \rightarrow \text{Spec } B$</span> is a homeomorphism. Thus, nilpotents do not affect the topological space.

          That is, the locus where <span class="mathjax">$f$</span> does not vanish. Informally, this is the doesn't-vanish-set, analogous to the terminology we used for vanishing set <span class="mathjax">$V(f)$</span>. The Zariski topology on the distinguished open set <span class="mathjax">$D(f) \subset \text{Spec } A$</span> coincides with the Zariski topology on <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A_f$</span>. Distinguished open sets form a nice base for the Zariski topology.

Then <span class="mathjax">$f$</span> is a function on the closed subset <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A/(g)$</span>, and by assumption, it vanishes on all points of the closed subset.

The key idea to show that this is an equivalent condition, is there existing nonzero <span class="mathjax">$a_1, a_2 \in A$</span> for which <span class="mathjax">$a_1^2 = a_1, a_2^2 = a_2, a_1 + a_2 = 1$</span> yielding <span class="mathjax">$a_1 a_2 = 0$</span>.

          <li>
            <mark>Irreducibility</mark>. A topological space is said to be irreducible if it is nonempty, and cannot be written as the union of two proper closed subsets. In other words, <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> is irreducible iff <span class="mathjax">$X = Y \cup Z \implies Y = X \vee Z = X$</span>. The notion isn't useful in classical geometry; for example, <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}^2$</span> is reducible, but <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^2$</span> is irreducible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <mark>Quasicompactness</mark>. A topological space <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> is said to be quasicompact, if given any open cover <span class="mathjax">$X = \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$</span>, there exists a subset <span class="mathjax">$S$</span> of index set <span class="mathjax">$I$</span> such that <span class="mathjax">$X = \bigcup_{i \in S} U_i$</span>. Informally, every open cover has a finite subcover. We can think of this condition as compactness minus the Hausdorff condition, but it isn't really the algebro-geometric analog of "compact", since we wouldn't want <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^1$</span> to be compact: the right analog is "properness", which we will define much later.

          A point <span class="mathjax">$p \in X$</span> is termed as a <mark>closed point</mark> if the subset <span class="mathjax">$\{p\}$</span> is closed.

The Nullstellansatz lets us interpret closed points of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\bar{k}^n$</span> as the maximal ideals in <span class="mathjax">$\bar{k}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$</span>. Henceforth "traditional points" will be called closed points, and "bonus points" will be called non-closed points when discussing <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\bar{k}^n$</span>.

          We now make precise the notion of one point contained within the closure of another point. <span class="mathjax">$x$</span> is termed as a <mark>specialization</mark> of <span class="mathjax">$y$</span>, and <span class="mathjax">$y$</span> is termed as the <mark>generalization</mark> of <span class="mathjax">$x$</span> if <span class="mathjax">$x = \overline{\{y\}}$</span>. For example, in <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^2$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$[(y - x^2)]$</span> is a generalization of <span class="mathjax">$[(x - 2, y - 4)] = (2, 4) \in \mathbb{C}^2$</span>.

          We say that <span class="mathjax">$p \in X$</span> is a <mark>generic point</mark> for a closed subset <span class="mathjax">$K$</span> if <span class="mathjax">$\overline{\{p\}} = K$</span>. If something is "generically" or "mostly" true for points in an irreducible subset, in the sense of being open for a dense open subset, then it is true of a generic point and vice-versa. For example, a function has value <span class="mathjax">$0$</span> in an integral scheme iff it has the value <span class="mathjax">$0$</span> at all points. The phrase <mark>general point</mark> does not have the same meaning: something being true for a general point means that it is true for all points in a dense open subset of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>. We will soon see that there is a natual bijection of the points of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span> and irreducible closed subsets of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span>, sending each point to its closure, and each irreducible closed subset to its unique generic point.

          An <mark>irreducible component</mark> of a topological space is a maximum irreducible subset; i.e. an irreducible component is not contained in a larger irreducible subset. Irreducible components are closed, as closure of irreducible subsets are irreducible. We think of the irreducible components of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> as maximal among the irreducible closed subsets of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>. Similarly, a <mark>connected component</mark> of a toplogical space is a maximum connected subset. Every topological space is the union of irreducible components. Similarly, every point is contained within a connected component, and connected components are always closed. On the other hand, connected components need not be open: as an example, consider <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec}(\prod_1^\infty \mathbb{F}_2)$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spaces can be broken up into a finite number of irreducible components. For example, in the locus of <span class="mathjax">$xy = 0 \in \mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^2$</span>, we think of the space as having two "pieces": the <span class="mathjax">$x$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$y$</span> axes. The reason for this is that the underlying topological space is <mark>Noetherian</mark>. In particular a topological space is said to be Noetherian if it satisfies the <mark>descending chain condition</mark> for closed subsets.

        <p>
          If <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> is a Noetherian topological space, then every nonempty subset <span class="mathjax">$Z$</span> can be expressed as a finite union of irreducible subsets: <span class="mathjax">$Z = Z_1 \cup \ldots \cup Z_n$</span>, none contained in the other. To prove this, we will use the technique of <mark>Noetherian induction</mark>. Consider the collection of closed subsets of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> which cannot be expressed as a finite union of irreducible closed subsets. Let <span class="mathjax">$Y_1$</span> be one such, and let it contain another such, call it <span class="mathjax">$Y_2$</span>. If <span class="mathjax">$Y_2$</span> contains another such, call it <span class="mathjax">$Y_3$</span>, and so on. By the d.c.c, this sequence must eventually stop, so let it stop at some <span class="mathjax">$Y_r$</span>, which cannot be written as a finite union of irreducible closed sets; moreover, every closed subset contained in it can be so written. But <span class="mathjax">$Y_r$</span> is not irreducible, so we can write <span class="mathjax">$Y_r = Y' \cup Y''$</span>, where <span class="mathjax">$Y', Y''$</span> are proper closed subsets. By hypothesis, both of these can be written as a finite union of closed irreducible sets, and hence so can <span class="mathjax">$Y_r$</span>, leading to a contradiction. Next we show uniqueness; let:<br/>
          $<span class="mathjax">$Z = Z_1 \cup \ldots \cup Z_r = Z'_1 \cup \ldots \cup Z'_s$</span>$
        </p>
        <p>
          be two such representations. Then, <span class="mathjax">$Z'_1 \subset Z_1 \cup \ldots \cup Z_r$</span> so <span class="mathjax">$Z'_1 = (Z_1 \cap Z'_1) \cup \ldots \cup (Z_r \cap Z'_1)$</span>. Since <span class="mathjax">$Z'_1$</span> is irreducible, one of these is equal to <span class="mathjax">$Z'_1$</span> itself; say <span class="mathjax">$Z_1 \cap Z'_1$</span> without loss of generality. Thus <span class="mathjax">$Z'_1 \subset Z_1 \subset Z'_a$</span> for some <span class="mathjax">$a$</span>. But hypothesis, <span class="mathjax">$Z'_1$</span> is not contained in any other <span class="mathjax">$Z'_i$</span>, leading to <span class="mathjax">$a = 1$</span>. Hence, <span class="mathjax">$Z'_1 = Z_1$</span>, and induction completes the proof.

        <p>
          It turns out that all the spectra we have considered are Noetherian topological spaces, but this isn't true of spectrum of all rings. A ring is Noetherian if the ideals satisfy <mark>ascending chain condition</mark>. Some trivial properties of Noetherian rings are:

        <p>
          Hence, any finitely generated algebra over <span class="mathjax">$k$</span> or <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{Z}$</span> is Noetherian. Example of a non-Noetherian ring: <span class="mathjax">$k[x_1, x_2, \ldots]$</span>, since the sequence of ideals does not terminate.

          <mark>Hilbert's Basis Theorem</mark>: If <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> is Noetherian, so is <span class="mathjax">$A[x]$</span>. To prove this, we show that any ideal <span class="mathjax">$I \subset A[x]$</span> is finitely-generated.

For <span class="mathjax">$n \gt 0$</span> if <span class="mathjax">$I \neq (f_1, \ldots, f_{n - 1})$</span>, let <span class="mathjax">$f_n = I - (f_1, \ldots, f_{n - 1})$</span> be a nonzero element of lowest degree. Thus, <span class="mathjax">$f_1$</span> is an element of <span class="mathjax">$I$</span> of lowest degree, assuming <span class="mathjax">$I \neq (0)$</span>. If this procedure terminates, then we are done. Otherwise, let <span class="mathjax">$a_n \in A$</span> be an initial coefficient of <span class="mathjax">$f_n$</span> for <span class="mathjax">$n \gt 0$</span>. Then, as <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> is Noetherian, <span class="mathjax">$(a_1, a_2, \ldots) = (a_1, \ldots, a_N)$</span> for some <span class="mathjax">$N$</span>. Let <span class="mathjax">$a_{N + 1} = \sum_{i = 1}^N b_i a_i$</span>. Then,<br/>

        <p>
          is an element of <span class="mathjax">$I$</span> that is nonzero, and of lower degree than <span class="mathjax">$f_{N + 1}$</span>, leading to a contradiction.

          All Noetherian rings yield Noetherian topological spaces, but the converse is not true.

Then <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span> is one point, so is Noetherian, but <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> is not Noetherian because <span class="mathjax">$(x_1) \subsetneq (x_1, x_2) \subsetneq (x_1, x_2, x_3) \subsetneq \ldots$</span>.

        <p>
          <span class="mathjax">$V(\bullet)$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$I(\bullet)$</span> give an inclusion-reversing bijection between closed subsets of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span> and radical ideals of <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>, where closed subset gives a radical ideal by <span class="mathjax">$I(\bullet)$</span>, and radical ideal gives closed subset by <span class="mathjax">$V(\bullet)$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that <span class="mathjax">$I(S)$</span> is always a radical ideal: if <span class="mathjax">$f \in \sqrt{I(S)}$</span>, then <span class="mathjax">$f^n$</span> vanishes on <span class="mathjax">$S$</span> for some <span class="mathjax">$n \gt 0$</span>, hence <span class="mathjax">$f$</span> vanishes on <span class="mathjax">$S$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$f \in I(S)$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A prime ideal is called a <mark>minimal prime</mark> if it is minimal with respect to inclusion. For example, the only minimal prime ideal of <span class="mathjax">$k[x, y]$</span> is <span class="mathjax">$(0)$</span>. A Noetherian ring has a finite number of minimal prime ideals.
