          Just as we defined schemes as (i) a set (ii) with a topology (iii) with a structure shceaf of functions, let us define morphisms between schemes <span class="mathjax">$X \rightarrow Y$</span> as (i) a map between sets (ii) that is continuous (iii) with some additional information about sheaves of functions. We want morphisms of affine schemes <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A \rightarrow \text{Spec } B$</span> to correspond to morphisms between rings <span class="mathjax">$B \rightarrow A$</span>. We have already seen that ring maps <span class="mathjax">$B \rightarrow A$</span> induce maps of topological spaces in the opposite direction. The main new ingredient will be adding the structure sheaf of functions to this. From the geometric side, we want morphisms of schemes to be, at the very least, a morphism between ringed spaces. If <span class="mathjax">$\pi : X \rightarrow Y$</span> is a map of differentiable manifolds, then a differentiable function on <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span> pulls back to a differentiable function on <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>. More precisely, given an open subset <span class="mathjax">$U \subset Y$</span>, there is a natural map <span class="mathjax">$\Gamma(U, \mathscr{O}_X) \rightarrow \Gamma(\pi^{-1}(U), \mathscr{O}_X)$</span>. This behaves well with respect to restriction, so we have a map on <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span>: <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \pi_* \mathscr{O}_X$</span>. Similarly a morphism of schemes <span class="mathjax">$\pi : X \rightarrow Y$</span> should induce <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \pi_* \mathscr{O}_X$</span>. In the category of differentiable manifolds, a continuous map <span class="mathjax">$\pi : X \rightarrow Y$</span> is a map of differentiable manifolds precisely when differentiable functions on <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span> pull back to differentiable functions on <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>, so this map of sheaves characterizes morphisms in a differentiable category. We could use this as the definition of a morphism in a differentiable category, but functions are odder than schemes, and we can't recover the pullback map from a map of topological spaces. The right patch is to hardwire this into the definition of the morphism: we have <span class="mathjax">$\pi : X \rightarrow Y$</span> along with the pullback map <span class="mathjax">$\pi^\# : \mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \pi_* \mathscr{O}_X$</span>, and this leads to the definition of ringed spaces. We might be able to define morphisms between sheaves as morphisms between ringed spaces, but this isn't quite right: to each morphism <span class="mathjax">$A \rightarrow B$</span> there is a corresponding morphism <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } B \rightarrow \text{Spec } A$</span>, but there can be additional morphisms of ringed spaces <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } B \rightarrow \text{Spec } A$</span> not arising in this way.

          Morphisms of ringed spaces

        <p>
          A morphism of ringed spaces <span class="mathjax">$\pi : X \rightarrow Y$</span> is a continuous map between topological spaces along with the pullback map <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \pi_* \mathscr{O}_X$</span>, which is the same thing as <span class="mathjax">$\pi^{-1} \mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \mathscr{O}_X$</span>, by adjointness. There is the obvious notion of composition, so ringed spaces form a category. We also have the notions of isomorphisms and automorphisms. If <span class="mathjax">$U \subset Y$</span> is an open subset, then we have the natural map of ringed spaces <span class="mathjax">$(U, \mathscr{O}_Y|_U) \rightarrow (Y, \mathscr{O}_Y)$</span>. More precisely, if <span class="mathjax">$U \rightarrow Y$</span> is an isomorphism of <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> with open subset <span class="mathjax">$V \subset Y$</span>, and we are given <span class="mathjax">$(U, \mathscr{O}_U) \cong (V, \mathscr{O}_Y|_V)$</span>, then the resulting map of ringed spaces is called an <mark>open embedding</mark> or <mark>open immersion</mark> of ringed spaces, and the morphism is written as <span class="mathjax">$U \hookrightarrow Y$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, consider the ring map <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}[y] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}[x]$</span> given by <span class="mathjax">$y \mapsto x^2$</span>. We are mapping the affine line with coordinate <span class="mathjax">$x$</span> with the affine line with coordinate <span class="mathjax">$y$</span>. The map is, on closed points, <span class="mathjax">$a \mapsto a^2$</span>. So, <span class="mathjax">$[(x - 3)]$</span> maps to <span class="mathjax">$[(x - 9)]$</span>, and the preimage of <span class="mathjax">$[(x - 4)]$</span> is <span class="mathjax">$[(x + 2)], [(x - 2)]$</span>. The pullback of <span class="mathjax">$3/(y - 4)$</span> on <span class="mathjax">$D([(y - 4)]) = \mathbb{A}^1 - \{4\}$</span> is <span class="mathjax">$3/(x^2 - 4)$</span> on <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}^2 - \{2, -2\}$</span>. Before we proceed, let us point out that every morphism of ringed spaces is not a morphism of locally ringed spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tentatively, maps of schemes <span class="mathjax">$(X, \mathscr{O}_X) \rightarrow (Y, \mathscr{O}_Y)$</span> is a map of ringed spaces that "looks locally like" maps of affine schemes. More precisely, for the choice of open sets <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A \subset X, \text{Spec } B \subset Y$</span>, such that <span class="mathjax">$\pi(\text{Spec } A) \subset \text{Spec } B$</span>, the induced maps of ringed spaces should look like:
        </p>
        <div class="mathjax">
          $$
          \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } B}(D(g)) \rightarrow \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A}(\pi^{-1} D(g))
          $$
        </div>
        <p>
          We would like this definition to be checkable on an affine open cover, and might hope to use the Affine Communication Lemma to develop the theory in this way. However, once we introduce locally ringed spaces, we will discard this tentative definition.

          From locally ringed spaces to morphism of schemes
        </h2>
        <p>
          The notion of locally ringed spaces is inspired by what we know about manifolds. If <span class="mathjax">$\pi : X \rightarrow Y$</span> is a morphism of manifolds, with <span class="mathjax">$\pi(p) = q$</span>, and <span class="mathjax">$f$</span> is a function on <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span> vanishing on <span class="mathjax">$q$</span>, then the pulled back function <span class="mathjax">$\pi^\#(f)$</span> on <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> should vanish at <span class="mathjax">$p$</span>. Put differently, germs vanishing at <span class="mathjax">$q \in Y$</span> should pull back to functions vanishing at germs of <span class="mathjax">$p \in X$</span>. A <mark>locally ringed space</mark> is a ringed space <span class="mathjax">$(X, \mathscr{O}_X)$</span> such that stalks <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_{X, p}$</span> are all local rings. The morphism of locally ringed spaces <span class="mathjax">$\pi : X \rightarrow Y$</span> is a morphism of ringed spaces such that the induced map of stalks <span class="mathjax">$\pi^\# : \mathscr{O}_{Y, q} \rightarrow \mathscr{O}_{X, p}$</span> sends the maximal ideals of the former to the maximal ideals of the latter (a <mark>morphism of local rings</mark>). Hence, if <span class="mathjax">$p \mapsto q$</span>, and <span class="mathjax">$g$</span> is a function vanishing at <span class="mathjax">$q$</span>, then it will pull back to a function vanishing at <span class="mathjax">$p$</span>. Also, if <span class="mathjax">$g$</span> is a function not vanishing at <span class="mathjax">$q$</span>, then it will pull back to a function not vanishing at <span class="mathjax">$p$</span>. Locally ringed spaces form a category. To summarize, a locally ringed space is one where (i) functions have values at points, and (ii) given a map of locally ringed spaces, the pullbacks where a function vanishes is precisely where the pulled back function vanishes.

          If <span class="mathjax">$\pi : \text{Spec } A \rightarrow \text{Spec } B$</span> is a morphism of locally ringed spaces, then it is the morphism of locally ringed spaces induced by the map <span class="mathjax">$\pi^\# : \Gamma(\text{Spec } B, \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } B}) = B \rightarrow \Gamma(\text{Spec } A, \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A}) = A$</span>. To prove this, we want to show that <span class="mathjax">$\pi$</span> is determined by its ring of global sections <span class="mathjax">$\pi^\# : B \rightarrow A$</span>. We first need to check that the map of points is determined by global sections. Now, a point <span class="mathjax">$p$</span> of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span> can be identified with the prime ideal of global functions vanishing on it. The image point <span class="mathjax">$\pi(p)$</span> can be identified with a unique point <span class="mathjax">$q$</span> in <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } B$</span>, where the functions vanishing at <span class="mathjax">$q$</span> are precisely those that pull back to functions vanishing at <span class="mathjax">$p$</span>. This is precisely the way in which maps of sets <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A \rightarrow \text{Spec } B$</span> induced by the ring map <span class="mathjax">$B \rightarrow A$</span> was defined. Note in particular that if <span class="mathjax">$b \in B$</span>, then <span class="mathjax">$\pi^{-1}(D(b)) = D(\pi^\# B)$</span>, again using the hypothesis that <span class="mathjax">$\pi$</span> is a morphism of locally ringed spaces. It remains to be shown that <span class="mathjax">$\pi^\# : \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } B} \rightarrow \pi_* \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A}$</span> is a morphism of sheaves. It suffices to check this on a distinguished base. We want to show that for any map of locally ringed spaces including the map of sheaves <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } B} \rightarrow \pi_* \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A}$</span>, the map of schemes on any distinguished open set <span class="mathjax">$D(b) \subset \text{Spec } B$</span> is determined by the map of global sections <span class="mathjax">$B \rightarrow A$</span>.

          Consider the commutative diagram:
        </p>
        <div class="mathjax">
          $$
          \begin{xy}
          \xymatrix{
          \Gamma(\text{Spec } B, \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } B})\ar[r]^{\pi^\#_{\text{Spec } B}}\ar[d]^{\text{res}_{\text{Spec } B, D(b)}} & \Gamma(\text{Spec } A, \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A})\ar[d]^{\text{res}_{\text{Spec } A, D(\pi^\# b)}} \\
          \Gamma(D(b), \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } B})\ar[r]^{\pi^\#_{D(b)}} & \Gamma(D(\pi^\# b), \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A})
          }
          \end{xy}
          $$
        </div>
        <p>
          The vertical arrows (restrictions to distinguished open sets) are localizations by <span class="mathjax">$b$</span>. The lower horizontal map <span class="mathjax">$\pi^\#_{D(b)}$</span> is determined by the upper map (it is just localization by <span class="mathjax">$b$</span>).
        </p>
        <p>
          If <span class="mathjax">$X, Y$</span> are schemes, then a morphism <span class="mathjax">$\pi : X \rightarrow Y$</span> as locally ringed spaces is a morphism of schemes. Thus, we have defined the category of schemes denoted by <span class="mathjax">$\text{Sch}$</span>. In practice, we will use the affine cover interpretation, and forget completely about locally ringed spaces. In particular, to put imprecisely, the category of affine schemes is the category of rings with arrows reversed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, there can be many different maps from one point to another. For example, here is a map of two maps from a point on <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } \mathbb{C}$</span> to another point on <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } \mathbb{C}$</span>: the identity map and the complex conjugation. It is clear that morphisms glue and that composition of two morphisms is a morphism.
