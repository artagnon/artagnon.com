          Let <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span> be the plane curve <span class="mathjax">$y = x^2$</span> (i.e. <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span> is the zero-set of the polynomial <span class="mathjax">$f = y - x^2$</span>). Show that <span class="mathjax">$A(Y)$</span> is isomorphic to the polynomial ring in one variable over <span class="mathjax">$k$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof: We need to show that <span class="mathjax">$A(Y) = k[x, y]/(y - x^2)$</span> is isomorphic to <span class="mathjax">$k[x]$</span>. To do this, consider <span class="mathjax">$k[x][y]$</span> as a polynomial in <span class="mathjax">$y$</span> adjointed with the solutions of <span class="mathjax">$y = x^2$</span>. The solutions lie in <span class="mathjax">$k[x]$</span>. Alternatively, the kernel of the isomorphism <span class="mathjax">$k[x, y]/(y - x^2) \xrightarrow{\varphi} k[x]$</span> is <span class="mathjax">$\text{Ker}(\varphi) = y - x^2$</span>, by the first isomorphism theorem <span class="mathjax">$\Box$</span>

        </p>
        <p>
          Proof: <span class="mathjax">$A(Z) = k[x, 1/x]$</span> contains an invertible element not in <span class="mathjax">$k$</span>, and is therefore not a polynomial ring over <span class="mathjax">$k$</span> <span class="mathjax">$\Box$</span>

        <hr class="horizrule" />

          Let <span class="mathjax">$Y \subseteq A^3$</span> be the set <span class="mathjax">$Y = \{t, t^2, t^3 \mid t \in k\}$</span>. Show that <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span> is an affine variety of dimension <span class="mathjax">$1$</span>. Find the generators for the ideal <span class="mathjax">$I(Y)$</span>. Show that <span class="mathjax">$A(Y)$</span> is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable over <span class="mathjax">$k$</span>. We say that <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span> is given by the parametric representation <span class="mathjax">$x = t, y = t^2, z = t^3$</span>, and this curve is called the <mark>twisted cubic</mark>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solution: <span class="mathjax">$A(Y) = k[x, y, z]/\langle z - y^2, z - x^3 \rangle \cong k[x]$</span>, since the solutions of the two polynomials lie in <span class="mathjax">$A^1$</span>. Generators of <span class="mathjax">$I(Y)$</span> are therefore <span class="mathjax">$\langle z - y^2, z - x^3 \rangle$</span> Futher, <span class="mathjax">$Y \cong A^1$</span>, and is hence an affine variety of dimension <span class="mathjax">$1$</span> <span class="mathjax">$\Box$</span>

          Suppose <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{F}(U)$</span> are maps to <span class="mathjax">$S = \underline{S}_{\text{pre}}(U)$</span> that are locally constant; i.e. for any <span class="mathjax">$p \in U$</span>, there is an open neighborhood of <span class="mathjax">$p$</span> where the function is constant. Show that this is a sheaf.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof: In the axioms of a presheaf, let the restriction map be the identity map. The gluability axiom of a sheaf is satisfied trivially <span class="mathjax">$\Box$</span>
        </p>
        <hr class="horizrule" />

          Show that the <a href="/ag/1#definition-of-presheaf-and-sheaf">pushforward</a> <span class="mathjax">$\pi_* \mathscr{F}$</span> is a sheaf, if <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{F}$</span> is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof: Suppose <span class="mathjax">$\pi : X \rightarrow Y$</span> is a continuous function, and <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{F}$</span> is a sheaf on <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>. Then, <span class="mathjax">$\pi_* \mathscr{F}(V) = \mathscr{F}(\pi^{-1}(V))$</span>, where <span class="mathjax">$V$</span> is an open subset of <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span>. To show that this is a presheaf, let <span class="mathjax">$U \subset X$</span> be the preimage of <span class="mathjax">$V$</span> under <span class="mathjax">$\pi^{-1}$</span>. Then, we have a restriction map for the inclusion map <span class="mathjax">$V \hookrightarrow U$</span>. Further, let <span class="mathjax">$\phi_* \mathscr{F}(U) = \mathscr{F}(\phi^{-1}(U))$</span>, where <span class="mathjax">$\phi : Z \rightarrow X$</span>. We end up with the inclusion map <span class="mathjax">$V \hookrightarrow U \hookrightarrow W$</span>, where <span class="mathjax">$W \subset Z$</span>. This satisfies the commutative diagram for the restriction map, and the gluability axiom for a sheaf, since <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{F}$</span> does <span class="mathjax">$\Box$</span>

          Pushforward induces maps of stalks. Suppose <span class="mathjax">$\pi : X \rightarrow Y$</span> is a continuous map and <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{F}$</span> is a sheaf of sets, rings or <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>-modules. If <span class="mathjax">$\pi(p) = q$</span>, describe the natural morphism of stalks <span class="mathjax">$(\pi_* \mathscr{F})_q \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_p$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solution: The task is to describe the map <span class="mathjax">$\underset{\longrightarrow}{\text{Lim }} \mathscr{F}(\pi^{-1}(V)) \rightarrow \underset{\longrightarrow}{\text{Lim }} \mathscr{F}(U)$</span>, where <span class="mathjax">$p \in U \subset X, q \in V \subset Y$</span>. This maps the colimit of the sheaf of the preimage of <span class="mathjax">$V$</span> to that of the subset <span class="mathjax">$U$</span>; in other words, what we have is the identity map <span class="mathjax">$\Box$</span>

        <p>
          If <span class="mathjax">$(X, \mathscr{O}_X)$</span> is a ringed space, and <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{F}$</span> is an <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_X$</span>-module, describe how for each <span class="mathjax">$p \in X$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{F}_p$</span> is an <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_{X, p}$</span>-module.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solution: For <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{F}$</span> to be an <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_X$</span>-module, the following diagram must commute, for <span class="mathjax">$U \subset V$</span>:

          Sheafification is a functor. Use the universal property to show that for any morphism <span class="mathjax">$\phi : \mathscr{F} \rightarrow \mathscr{G}$</span> of presheaves induces the natural map <span class="mathjax">$\phi^\text{sh} : \mathscr{F}^\text{sh} \rightarrow \mathscr{G}^\text{sh}$</span> of sheaves. Hence, show that sheafification is a functor from presheaves on <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> to sheaves on <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>.

          Suppose <span class="mathjax">$\pi^\# : Y \rightarrow X$</span> is a morphism of rings. Define <span class="mathjax">$\pi : \text{Spec } X \rightarrow \text{Spec } Y$</span> to be a morphism of ringed spaces as follows. The map of topological spaces is defined in the usual way. To describe a morphism of sheaves <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } B} \rightarrow \pi_* \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A}$</span> on <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } B$</span>, it suffices to describe a morphism of sheaves on the distinguished base of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } B$</span>. On <span class="mathjax">$D(g) \subset \text{Spec } B$</span>, we define:
        </p>
        <div class="mathjax">
          $$
          \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } B}(D(g)) \rightarrow \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A}(\pi^{-1} D(g))
          $$
        </div>
        <p>
          by <span class="mathjax">$B_g \rightarrow A_{\pi^\# g}$</span>. Show that this describes a morphism of sheaves on a distinguished base.

          Show that a morphism of schemes <span class="mathjax">$\pi : X \rightarrow Y$</span> is a morphism of ringed spaces that looks locally like morphisms of affine schemes. Put precisely, if <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span> is an affine open subset of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } B$</span> is an affine open subset of <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span>, and <span class="mathjax">$\pi(\text{Spec } A) \subset \text{Spec } B$</span>, then the induced morphism of ringed spaces is a morphism of affine schemes. Show that it suffices to check on a set <span class="mathjax">$(\text{Spec } A_i, \text{Spec } B_i)$</span> where <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A_i$</span> form an open cover of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } B_i$</span> form an open cover of <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span>.
