          The final ingredient in the definition of an affine scheme is the structure sheaf <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A}$</span>, which we will think of as the sheaf of algebraic functions. For example, in <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}^2$</span>, we expect that on the open set <span class="mathjax">$D(xy)$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$(3x^4 + y + 7)/(x^3 y^8)$</span> is an algebraic function. The function will have values at points, but won't be determined by their values at points; instead, they will be determined by their germs. It suffices to describe the structure sheaf as the sheaf of rings on the base of distinguished open sets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Define <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A}(D(f))$</span> to be the localization of ring <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> at the multiplicative sets of all functions that do not vanish outside of <span class="mathjax">$V(f)$</span>; i.e. those <span class="mathjax">$g$</span> for which <span class="mathjax">$V(g) \subset V(f)$</span> or equivalently <span class="mathjax">$I(f) \subset I(g)$</span>. This depends only on <span class="mathjax">$D(f)$</span> and not on <span class="mathjax">$f$</span> itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          If <span class="mathjax">$D(f') \subset D(f)$</span>, define the restriction map:
        </p>
        <div class="mathjax">
          $$
          \text{res}_{D(f), D(f')} : \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A}(D(f)) \rightarrow \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A}(D(f'))
          $$
        </div>
        <p>
          in the obvious way; the latter ring is a further restriction of the former ring. The restriction maps obviously commute, and this is a presheaf on a distinguished base.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data just described give a sheaf on a distinguished open set, and hence determine a sheaf on the topological space on <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span>. The topological space along with the structure sheaf will be called an <mark>affine scheme</mark>. The notation <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span> will henceforth denote the data of the topological space along with the structure sheaf. <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A}$</span> contains data not just of the sheaf, but also the underlying distinguished base that provides a good way of working with <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A}$</span>. To prove this, we need to show that base gluability and base identity axioms hold on <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span>. Suppose <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A = \bigcup_{i \in I} D({f_i})$</span>, or equivalently, the ideal generated by <span class="mathjax">$f_i$</span> is the entire ring <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>. By quasicompactness of <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A = \bigcup_{i = 1}^n D({f_i})$</span> for finite <span class="mathjax">$n$</span>; i.e. <span class="mathjax">$(f_1, \ldots, f_n) = A$</span>. Suppose we are given <span class="mathjax">$s \in A$</span> such that <span class="mathjax">$\text{res}_{\text{Spec } A, D(f_i)} s = 0$</span> for all <span class="mathjax">$A_{f_i}$</span> for all <span class="mathjax">$i$</span>; then we wish to show that <span class="mathjax">$s = 0$</span>. This implies that there is some <span class="mathjax">$m$</span> such that for all <span class="mathjax">$i \in {1, \ldots, n}$</span> such that <span class="mathjax">$f_i^m s = 0$</span>. Now, <span class="mathjax">$(f_1^m, \ldots, f_n^m) = A$</span>, so there are <span class="mathjax">$r_i \in A$</span> with <span class="mathjax">$\sum_{i = 1}^n r_i f_i^m = 1$</span> from which<br/>
          $<span class="mathjax">$s = \sum_{i = 1}^n r_i (f_i^m s) = 0$</span>$
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, we have shown base identity axiom. For the base gluability axiom, we have <span class="mathjax">$a_i/f_i^{l_i} \in A_f$</span> agreeing on overlaps <span class="mathjax">$A_{f_i, f_j}$</span>. Letting <span class="mathjax">$g_i = f_i^{l_i}$</span>, using <span class="mathjax">$D(g_i) = D(f_i)$</span>, our elements are of the form <span class="mathjax">$a_i/g_i \in A_{g_i}$</span>. The fact that <span class="mathjax">$a_i/g_i$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$a_j/g_j$</span> agree on overlap means that for some <span class="mathjax">$m_{ij}$</span>,<br/>
          $<span class="mathjax">$(g_i g_j)^{m_{ij}} (g_j a_i - g_i a_j) = 0$</span>$
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking <span class="mathjax">$m = \text{max } m_{ij}$</span>, we get:<br/>
          $<span class="mathjax">$(g_i g_j)^m (g_j a_i - g_i a_j) = 0$</span>$
        </p>
        <p>
          for all <span class="mathjax">$i, j$</span>. Let <span class="mathjax">$b_i = a_i g_i^m$</span> for all <span class="mathjax">$i$</span>, and <span class="mathjax">$h_i = g_i^{m + 1}$</span>, so <span class="mathjax">$D(h_i) = D(g_i)$</span>. On each <span class="mathjax">$D(h_i)$</span>, we have a function <span class="mathjax">$b_i/h_i$</span>, and the overlap condition is:<br/>
          $<span class="mathjax">$h_j b_i = h_i b_j$</span>$
        </p>
        <p>
          Now <span class="mathjax">$\bigcup D(h_i) = \text{Spec } A$</span> implying that <span class="mathjax">$1 = \sum r_i h_i$</span>, for some <span class="mathjax">$r_i \in A$</span>. Define <span class="mathjax">$r = \sum r_i b_i$</span>. This will be an element of <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> that restricts to each <span class="mathjax">$b_i/h_j$</span>. Indeed, from the overlap condition,<br/>
          $<span class="mathjax">$r_j h_j = \sum_i r_i h_i b_j = b_j$</span>$
        </p>
        <p>
          completing the proof.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose <span class="mathjax">$M$</span> is an <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>-module. The following construction describes sheaf <span class="mathjax">$\tilde{M}$</span> on a distinguished base. Define <span class="mathjax">$\tilde{M}(D(f))$</span> to be the localization of <span class="mathjax">$M$</span> at a multiplicative set of all functions that do not vanish on <span class="mathjax">$V(f)$</span>. Define restriction maps <span class="mathjax">$\text{res}_{D(f), D(g)}$</span> in an analogous way to <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A}$</span>. This defines a sheaf on a distinguished base, and hence on <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span>. Hence, this is an <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A}$</span>-module.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A}(U)$</span> is not a localization of <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> at the multiplicative set of functions that do not vanish at any point on <span class="mathjax">$U$</span>. For instance, let <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span> be two copies of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_k^2$</span> glued together at their origins, and <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> be a complement of the origins. Then, the function which is <span class="mathjax">$1$</span> on the first copy of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_k^2/\{(0, 0)\}$</span> is <span class="mathjax">$0$</span> on the second copy of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_k^2/\{(0, 0)\}$</span>. Let us collect five counter-examples which we will see in more detail later:
        </p>
        <ol class="olitems" type="a" start="1">
          <li>
            The cone over the quadratic surface, <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$\text{Proj } A$</span>, where <span class="mathjax">$A = k[w, x, y, z]/(wz - xy)$</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Two planes meeting at a point.
          </li>
          <li>
            Affine plane minus the origin, <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}^n - 0$</span>; its inclusion with <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}^n$</span>; and <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}^n$</span> with its doubled origin; each with <span class="mathjax">$n = 1, 2, \infty$</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Infinite disjoint union of schemes, especially, <span class="mathjax">$\bigsqcup \text{Spec } k[x]/(x^n)$</span>.

          <li>
            <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } \bar{\mathbb{Q}} \rightarrow \text{Spec } \mathbb{Q}$</span>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="visualizing-schems-nilpotents">
          Visualizing schems: nilpotents
        </h2>
        <p>
          In the affine scheme <span class="mathjax">$(\text{Spec } A, \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A})$</span>, the information about nilpotents is invisible at the level of points. We have the following inclusion-reversing bijections:
        </p>
        <ol class="olitems" type="a" start="1">
          <li>
            Maximal ideals of <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> <span class="mathjax">$\leftrightarrow$</span> closed points of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            Prime ideals of <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> <span class="mathjax">$\leftrightarrow$</span> irreducible closed subsets of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            Nilradicals of <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> <span class="mathjax">$\leftrightarrow$</span> closed subsets of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Our goal now is to figure out how to picture ideals that are not radical. We immediately picture <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x]/x(x - 1)(x - 2)$</span> as closed subsets of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^2$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$\{0, 1, 2\}$</span>. In particular, the map <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^2/x(x - 1)(x - 2)$</span> can be shown to be a restriction of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^2$</span> to <span class="mathjax">$\{0, 1, 2\}$</span>. Similarly, <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}[x]/(x^2)$</span> can be thought of as a point at the origin with some "fuzz" remembering information about the first derivative.
        </p>
        <div class="mathjax">
          $$
          \mathbb{C}[x] \twoheadrightarrow \mathbb{C}[x]/(x^2) \twoheadrightarrow \mathbb{C}[x]/(x)
          $$
        </div>
        <p>
          <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}[x, y]/(x, y)^3$</span> can be pictured as a "circular fuzz" around origin remembering first and second derivatives, while <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}[x, y]/(x^2, y^2)$</span> can be thought of as a square fuzz around origin that is circumscribed by <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}[x, y]/(x, y)^3$</span>, and inscribed by <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}[x, y]/(x, y)^2$</span>. In fact, given two ideals <span class="mathjax">$I, J$</span> of <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A/IJ$</span> should be pictured as the intersection of pictures <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A/I$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A/J$</span> in <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span>. As another example, consider a polynomial in <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{C}[x, y]/(y^2, xy)$</span>; knowing what it is is equivalent to knowing its values on the <span class="mathjax">$x$</span>-axis, as well as its first-derivative information around the origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, consider the intersection of the parabola <span class="mathjax">$y = x^2$</span> and the <span class="mathjax">$x$</span>-axis:
        </p>
        <div class="mathjax">
          $$
          \begin{align*}
          \text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x, y]/(y - x^2) \cap \text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x, y]/(y) &= \text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x, y]/(y - x^2, y) \\
          &= \text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x, y]/(x^2, y)
          \end{align*}
          $$
        </div>
        <p>
          We interpret this intersection as having multiplicity <span class="mathjax">$2$</span> on the <span class="mathjax">$x$</span>-axis.
        </p>
        <h2 id="definition-of-schemes">
          Definition of schemes
        </h2>
        <p>
          First, define isomorphism of ringed spaces <span class="mathjax">$(X, \mathscr{O}_X), (Y, \mathscr{O}_Y)$</span> as:
        </p>
        <ol class="olitems" type="a" start="1">
          <li>
            A homeomorphism from <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> to <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            An isomorphism of sheaves <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_X, \mathscr{O}_Y$</span>, considered to be on the same space via <span class="mathjax">$\pi$</span>. In other words, it is the isomorphism <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \pi_* \mathscr{O}_X$</span>, or equivalently using adjoints, <span class="mathjax">$\pi^{-1} \mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \mathscr{O}_X$</span> of sheaves on <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          We have a correspondence between sets, topologies, and structure sheaves. An <mark>affine scheme</mark> is a ringed space isomorphic to <span class="mathjax">$(\text{Spec } A, \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A})$</span> for some <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>. A <mark>scheme</mark> <span class="mathjax">$(X, \mathscr{O}_X)$</span> is a ringed space such that every point <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> has open neighborhood <span class="mathjax">$U$</span>, and <span class="mathjax">$(X, \mathscr{O}_X|_U)$</span> is an affine scheme. The topology on a scheme is the Zariski topology. The isomorphism between two schemes is an isomorphism as ringed spaces. If <span class="mathjax">$U \subset X$</span> is an open set, <span class="mathjax">$\Gamma(U, \mathscr{O}_X)$</span> is said to be a function on <span class="mathjax">$U$</span>; this generalizes in the obvious way to functions on an affine scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the definition of a structure sheaf on an affine scheme, if <span class="mathjax">$(X, \mathscr{O}_X)$</span> is an affine scheme, we can recover its ring <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> where <span class="mathjax">$X = \text{Spec } A$</span> by taking global sections as <span class="mathjax">$X = D(1)$</span>:<br/>
          $<span class="mathjax">$\Gamma(X, \mathscr{O}_X) = \Gamma(D(1), \mathscr{O}_X) = A$</span>$
        </p>
        <p>
          We can recognize <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> as the scheme on <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span>: we get the isomorphism <span class="mathjax">$\pi : (\text{Spec } \Gamma(X, \mathscr{O}_X), \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } \Gamma(X, \mathscr{O}_X)}) \rightarrow (X, \mathscr{O}_X)$</span>. For example, if <span class="mathjax">$\mathfrak{m}$</span> is a maximal ideal of <span class="mathjax">$\Gamma(X, \mathscr{O}_X)$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$\{\pi(\mathfrak{m})\} = V(\mathfrak{m})$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given <span class="mathjax">$f \in A$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$\Gamma(D(f), \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A}) = A_f$</span>. Under natural inclusion <span class="mathjax">$A_f \hookrightarrow A$</span>, the Zariski topology on <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span> restricts to that in <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A_f$</span>. Moreover, the structure sheaf on <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span> restricts to the structure sheaf on <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A_f$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We say that <span class="mathjax">$(U, \mathscr{O}_X|_U)$</span> is an <mark>open subscheme</mark> of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>. If <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> is also an affine scheme, <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> is called <mark>affine open subscheme</mark>, or simply <mark>affine open</mark>. For example, <span class="mathjax">$D(f)$</span> is an affine open subscheme.
        </p>
        <p>
          Open subsets of schemes come with a natural scheme structure. For comparison, closed subschemes on <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> are, informally, a particular kind of scheme structure on closed subsets of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>. For example, if <span class="mathjax">$I \subset A$</span> is an ideal, then <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A/I$</span> endows <span class="mathjax">$V(I) \subset \text{Spec } A$</span> with a scheme structure, but note that there can be different ideals with the same vanishing set; for example, <span class="mathjax">$(x), (x^2)$</span> in <span class="mathjax">$k[x]$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stalk of sheaf <span class="mathjax">$\tilde{M}$</span> at point <span class="mathjax">$[\mathfrak{p}]$</span> is <span class="mathjax">$M_\mathfrak{p}$</span>. A section is determined by its germs meaning that <span class="mathjax">$M \rightarrow \prod_p M_p$</span> is an inclusion. For example, an <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>-module is zero iff all its localizations at prime ideals are zero.

          We say that a ringed space is a <mark>locally ringed space</mark> if all its stalks are local rings. Schemes and manifolds are examples of locally ringed spaces. Taking quotient at the maximal ideal can be interpreted as evaluation at the point. The maximal ideal of a local ring <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_{X, p}$</span> is denoted by <span class="mathjax">$m_p$</span> and the residue field <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_{X, p}/m_p$</span> is denoted by <span class="mathjax">$\kappa[p]$</span>. Functions on an open subset <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> of a locally ringed space have values at each point of <span class="mathjax">$U$</span>. The value <span class="mathjax">$p$</span> of such a function lies in <span class="mathjax">$\kappa[p]$</span>. We say that a function vanishes at point <span class="mathjax">$p$</span> if its value at <span class="mathjax">$p$</span> is <span class="mathjax">$0$</span>. Notice that we can't even make sense of a "function vanishing" on a ringed space in general.

          We can really work with a structure sheaf, and can compute the ring of sections of open sets that aren't just distinguished open sets of affine schemes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <mark>First example</mark>: The plane minus the origin. Our goal here is to show that a distinguished base is something we can work with. Let <span class="mathjax">$A = k[x, y]$</span> so that <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A = \mathbb{A}_k^2$</span>. Let us work with the space of functions in <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}^2 - \{(0, 0)\} = \mathbb{A}^2 - \{[(x, y)]\}$</span>. It is not immediately obvious if this is a distinguished open set. In any case, we can describe the union of two distinguished open sets <span class="mathjax">$U = D(x) \cup D(y)$</span>. We will find functions in <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> by gluing together functions in <span class="mathjax">$D(x)$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$D(y)$</span>. Functions on <span class="mathjax">$D(x)$</span> are, by definition, <span class="mathjax">$A_x = [x, y, 1/x]$</span>, and those on <span class="mathjax">$D(y)$</span> are <span class="mathjax">$A_y = [x, y, 1/y]$</span>. Notice that <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> injects into its localizations, as it is an integral domain, so it injects onto both <span class="mathjax">$A_x$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$A_y$</span>, and both inject into <span class="mathjax">$A_{xy}$</span>; indeed <span class="mathjax">$k[x, y] = K(A)$</span>. So we are looking for functions on <span class="mathjax">$D(x) \cap D(y) = D(xy)$</span>; i.e. we are interpreting <span class="mathjax">$A_x \cap A_y$</span> in <span class="mathjax">$A_{xy}$</span> or in <span class="mathjax">$k(x, y)$</span>. Clearly, those rational functions with powers in <span class="mathjax">$x$</span> in the denominator and those with powers in <span class="mathjax">$y$</span> in the denominator, are the polynomials. In other words, <span class="mathjax">$A_x \cap A_y = A$</span>. Thus we get:<br/>
          $<span class="mathjax">$\Gamma(U, \mathscr{O}_{A^2}) \equiv k[x, y]$</span>$
        </p>
        <p>
          We get no extra functions by removing the origin. Notice how any function on <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}^2 - \{(0, 0)\}$</span> extends over all of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}^2$</span>. This is an analog of <mark>Hartogs's lemma</mark> in complex geometry: any holomorphic function defined on the complement of a set of codimension atleast two can be extended to a complex manifold over the missing set. This works in a general algebraic setting: we can extend points in codimension atleast two, not only if they are smooth, but also if they are mildly singular (or <mark>normal</mark>).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="mathjax">$(U, \mathscr{O}_{A^2}|_U)$</span> is a scheme but not an affine scheme. Otherwise, <span class="mathjax">$(U, \mathscr{O}_{A^2}|_U) = (\text{Spec } A, \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A})$</span>, then we can recover <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> by taking global sections:<br/>
          $<span class="mathjax">$A = \Gamma(U, \mathscr{O}_{A^2}|_U)$</span>$
        </p>
        <p>
          So if <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> is affine, then <span class="mathjax">$U \cong \mathbb{A}_k^2$</span>. But this bijection between prime ideals in a ring and points in the spectrum of the ring is more constructive than that: given prime ideal <span class="mathjax">$I$</span>, you can recover the point as a generic point of the closed subset cut out by <span class="mathjax">$I$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$V(I)$</span>, and given point <span class="mathjax">$p$</span>, you can recover the ideal as those functions vanishing at <span class="mathjax">$p$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$I(p)$</span>. In particular, the prime ideal <span class="mathjax">$(x, y)$</span> should cut out a point of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } A$</span>. But on <span class="mathjax">$U$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$V(x) \cap V(y) = \phi$</span>. In conclusion, <span class="mathjax">$(U$</span> is not an affine scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have now seen two examples of non-affine schemes: infinite disjoint union of nonempty schemes, and <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}^2 - \{(0, 0)\}$</span>. Before reviewing more examples, let us see how to glue topological spaces together along isomorphic open sets. Given two topological spaces <span class="mathjax">$X, Y$</span> and open subsets <span class="mathjax">$U \subset X, V \subset Y$</span>, along with the homeomorphism <span class="mathjax">$U \overset{\sim}{\longleftrightarrow} V$</span>, we can create a new topological space <span class="mathjax">$W$</span>, that we obtain by gluing together <span class="mathjax">$X, Y$</span> along <span class="mathjax">$U \overset{\sim}{\longleftrightarrow} V$</span>. It is the quotient of the disjoint union <span class="mathjax">$X \sqcup Y$</span> by equivalence relation <span class="mathjax">$U \sim V$</span>, where the quotient is given by quotient topology. Then <span class="mathjax">$X, Y$</span> are naturally identified with open subsets of <span class="mathjax">$W$</span>, and indeed cover <span class="mathjax">$W$</span>. Now, let us glue schemes <span class="mathjax">$(X, \mathscr{O}_X), (Y, \mathscr{O}_Y)$</span> together. Let <span class="mathjax">$U \subset X, V \subset Y$</span> be open subsets, along with a homeomorphism <span class="mathjax">$U \xrightarrow{\sim} V$</span>, and isomorphism of structure sheaves <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{O}_V \xrightarrow{\sim} \pi_* \mathscr{O}_U$</span>; i.e. an isomorphism of sheaves <span class="mathjax">$(U, \mathscr{O}_X|_U) \cong (V, \mathscr{O}_X|_V)$</span>. Then, we can glue these together to get a single scheme; let <span class="mathjax">$W$</span> be <span class="mathjax">$X, Y$</span> glued together using <span class="mathjax">$U \cong V$</span>. Then the structure sheaves can be glued together to get a sheaf of rings. This is indeed a scheme: any point has an the open neighborhood that is an affine scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we will look at examples of non-affine schemes by gluing together <span class="mathjax">$X = \text{Spec } k[t], Y = \text{Spec } k[u]$</span>. Let <span class="mathjax">$U = D(t) = k[t, 1/t] \subset X, V = D(u) = k[u, 1/u] \subset Y$</span>. In both examples, we will glue <span class="mathjax">$X, Y$</span> along <span class="mathjax">$U, V$</span>; the difference is in how we glue.
        </p>
        <p>
          <mark>Second example</mark>: Affine line with doubled origin. Consider the isomorphism <span class="mathjax">$U \simeq V$</span> via <span class="mathjax">$k[t, 1/t] \simeq k[u, 1/u]$</span> given by <span class="mathjax">$t \leftrightarrow u$</span>. This can be intuitively thought of as an analog of failure of Hausdorffness, although <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}^1$</span> itself is not Hausdorff. We will define separatedness later, which will be the right condition for Hausdorffness. In a separated scheme, the affine base of a Zariski topology is nice: the intersection of two open affine sets will be affine.
        </p>
        <p>
          <mark>Third example</mark>: The projective line. Consider isomorphism <span class="mathjax">$U \cong V$</span> via the isomorphism <span class="mathjax">$k[t, 1/t] \cong k[u, 1/u]$</span> given by <span class="mathjax">$t \leftrightarrow 1/u$</span>. The resulting scheme is called the projective line over field <span class="mathjax">$k$</span>, and is denoted by <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}_k^1$</span>. Traditional point <span class="mathjax">$a$</span> on the <span class="mathjax">$t$</span>-line is glued to point <span class="mathjax">$1/a$</span> on the <span class="mathjax">$u$</span>-line assuming <span class="mathjax">$a \neq 0$</span>, and generic point <span class="mathjax">$(0)$</span> on the <span class="mathjax">$t$</span>-line maps to the generic point <span class="mathjax">$(0)$</span> on the <span class="mathjax">$u$</span>-line, under the isomorphism <span class="mathjax">$t \rightarrow 1/u$</span>. If <span class="mathjax">$k$</span> is algebraically closed, we can interpret the closed points of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}_k^1$</span> in the following way: the points are <span class="mathjax">$[a, b]$</span> where both <span class="mathjax">$a, b$</span> are nonzero, and <span class="mathjax">$[a, b]$</span> is identified with <span class="mathjax">$[ac, bc], c \in k^\times$</span>. If <span class="mathjax">$b \neq 0$</span>, this is identified with <span class="mathjax">$a/b$</span> on the <span class="mathjax">$t$</span>-line, and if <span class="mathjax">$a \neq 0$</span>, this is identified with <span class="mathjax">$b/a$</span> on the <span class="mathjax">$u$</span>-line.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prove that <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}_k^1$</span> is not affine, we compute the ring of global sections. Global sections correspond to sections on <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> and sections on <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span> that agree on overlap. Restricting to overlap, we get polynomials <span class="mathjax">$f(t)$</span> in <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>, and <span class="mathjax">$g(u)$</span> in <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span>. We want <span class="mathjax">$f(t) = g(1/t)$</span>, but the only polynomials that are both polynomials in <span class="mathjax">$t$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$1/t$</span> are the constants <span class="mathjax">$k$</span>. Thus, if <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}_k^1$</span> we affine, <span class="mathjax">$\Gamma(\mathbb{P}^1, \mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}) = k$</span>, and hence, <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } \Gamma(\mathbb{P}^1, \mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}) = \text{Spec } k$</span>, i.e. one point. But it isn't: it has lots of points. We have proved an analog of an important theorem: the only holomorphic functions on <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{CP}^1$</span> are constants.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will now define projective <span class="mathjax">$n$</span>-space over field <span class="mathjax">$k$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}_k^n$</span>, by gluing <span class="mathjax">$n + 1$</span> open sets, each isomorphic to <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{A}_n^k$</span>. We think of points <span class="mathjax">$(x_0, x_1)$</span> in the projective space as being equivalent upto scalars; <span class="mathjax">$(\lambda x_0, \lambda x_1)$</span> is equivalent to <span class="mathjax">$(x_0, x_1)$</span>. The first patch can be thought of as points <span class="mathjax">$[1, t]$</span> where <span class="mathjax">$t = x_1/x_0, x_0 \neq 0$</span>, and the second patch can be thought of as points <span class="mathjax">$[u, 1]$</span> where <span class="mathjax">$u = x_0/x_1, x_1 \neq 0$</span>. It will be useful, to instead use the notation <span class="mathjax">$x_{0/1}$</span> for <span class="mathjax">$u$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$x_{1/0}$</span> for <span class="mathjax">$t$</span>. Then, the <span class="mathjax">$i^{th}$</span> open set will have coordinates <span class="mathjax">$x_{0/i}, \ldots, x_{i/i}, \ldots, x_{n/i}$</span>. It will be convenient to write this as:<br/>
          $<span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } k[x_{1/i}, \ldots, x_{n/i}]/(x_{i/i} - 1)$</span>$
        </p>
        <p>
          so we have introduced dummy variable <span class="mathjax">$x_{i/i}$</span> which we immediately set to <span class="mathjax">$1$</span>. We glue distinguished open sets <span class="mathjax">$D(x_{i/j})$</span> of <span class="mathjax">$U_j$</span> to distinguished open sets <span class="mathjax">$D(x_{j/i})$</span> of <span class="mathjax">$U_i$</span>, by identifying these two schemes by describing the identification of rings

        <div class="mathjax">

          \text{Spec } k[x_{1/i}, \ldots, x_{n/i}]/(x_{i/i} - 1) \cong \\
          \text{Spec } k[x_{1/j}, \ldots, x_{n/j}]/(x_{j/j} - 1)
          $$

          via <span class="mathjax">$x_{k/i} = x_{k/j}/x_{i/j}$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$x_{k/j} = x_{k/i}/x_{j/i}$</span>, which implies that <span class="mathjax">$x_{i/j} x_{j/i} = 1$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <mark>Chinese remainder theorem</mark> is embedded in our argument; it can be thought of as a geometric fact. The prime ideals of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{Z}/60$</span> are <span class="mathjax">$(2), (3), (5)$</span>, and its stalks are <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{Z}/4, \mathbb{Z}/3, \mathbb{Z}/5$</span>. Nilpotents at <span class="mathjax">$(2)$</span> can be thought of as a fuzz at <span class="mathjax">$(2)$</span> in the corresponding picture. The global sections on this scheme are sections on the open sets <span class="mathjax">$(2), (3)$</span>, and <span class="mathjax">$(5)$</span>. Indeed, there is a natural isomorphism of rings:<br/>
          $<span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{Z}/60 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/4 \times \mathbb{Z}/3 \times \mathbb{Z}/5$</span>$

        <h2 id="projective-schemes">
          Projective schemes
        </h2>
        <p>
          Schemes that were of interest in classical geometry are projective schemes or open subsets thereof, <mark>quasiprojective</mark> schemes. There are very few examples of schemes that are not provably quasiprojective. The notion of a projective <span class="mathjax">$k$</span>-scheme is a good approximation of the algebro-geometric version of compactness, or <mark>properness</mark>. Although projective schemes can be obtained by gluing together affine schemes, it can be annoying to keep track of gluing information. Just as there is a rough correspondence between rings and affine schemes, there is also a correspondence between graded rings and projective schemes. <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}^n$</span> can be interpreted as lines through origin in <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{R}^{n + 1}$</span>, and subsets as unions of lines thereof, and closed subsets as such unions that are closed. We can picture <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}^n$</span> as being points at infinite distance in <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{R}^{n + 1}$</span>, with points at infinity in one direction being associated with points at infinitely in the other direction. To make this precise, let us define the decomposition:<br/>
          $<span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}^{n + 1} = \mathbb{R}^{n + 1} \bigsqcup \mathbb{P}^n$</span>$
        </p>
        <p>
          by which we mean that the open subset of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}^{n + 1}$</span> is identified with <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{R}^{n + 1}$</span>, the points with the last projective coordinate nonzero, and the complementary closed subset <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}^n$</span> with the last coordinate zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, an equation cutting out a set of points <span class="mathjax">$V$</span> in <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}^n$</span> also cut out a set of points in <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{R}^{n + 1}$</span> that will be a closed union of lines. We will call this the <mark>affine cone</mark> of <span class="mathjax">$V$</span>. This equation will cut out some union of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}^1$</span>s in <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}^{n + 1}$</span>, and we will call this the <mark>projective cone</mark> of <span class="mathjax">$V$</span>. The projective cone is the disjoint union of the affine cone and <span class="mathjax">$V$</span>. For example, the affine cone defined by <span class="mathjax">$x^2 + y^2 = z^2$</span> in <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}^2$</span> can be pictured as a classical cone in <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{R}^3$</span>. For our <span class="mathjax">$\text{Proj}$</span> construction, we switch coordinates from <span class="mathjax">$x, y, z$</span> to <span class="mathjax">$x_0, x_1, x_2$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We informally observe that degree <span class="mathjax">$d$</span> polynomials in <span class="mathjax">$n + 1$</span> variables over a field form a vector space of dimension <span class="mathjax">$\begin{pmatrix} n + d \\ d \end{pmatrix}$</span>. It is not true that any two polynomials cut out the same subset of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}_k^n$</span> if one is a nonzero multiple of the other; <span class="mathjax">$x^2 y = 0$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$x y^2 = 0$</span> show this. Instead, two polynomials cut out the same <mark>closed subscheme</mark> if one is a nonzero multiple of the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <span class="mathjax">$\text{Proj}$</span> construction produces a scheme out of a <mark>graded ring</mark>. We will now discuss graded rings. A <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{Z}$</span>-graded ring is <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet = \oplus_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} S_n$</span>, where the subscript is called <mark>grading</mark>; i.e. it sends <span class="mathjax">$S_m \times S_n$</span> to <span class="mathjax">$S_{m + n}$</span>. Clearly <span class="mathjax">$S_0$</span> is a subring, each <span class="mathjax">$S_n$</span> is an <span class="mathjax">$S_0$</span>-module, and <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet$</span> is an <span class="mathjax">$S_0$</span>-algebra. Suppose that <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet$</span> is a <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{Z}$</span>-graded ring. Those elements of some <span class="mathjax">$S_n$</span> are called homogenous elements of <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet$</span>; nonzero homogenous elements have an obvious degree. An ideal <span class="mathjax">$I$</span> of <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet$</span> is a <mark>homogenous ideal</mark> if it is generated by homogenous elements. If <span class="mathjax">$T$</span> is a multiplicative subset of <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet$</span> containing only homogenous elements, then <span class="mathjax">$T^{-1} S_\bullet$</span> has a natural structure as a <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{Z}$</span>-graded ring.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{Z}^{\geq 0}$</span> ring is a <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{Z}$</span>-graded ring with no elements of negative degree. Henceforth, a graded ring will refer to <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{Z}^{\geq 0}$</span> ring. <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet$</span> is assumed to be a graded ring. Fix ring <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> as the <mark>base ring</mark>. If <span class="mathjax">$S_0 = A$</span>, we say that <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet$</span> is a graded ring over <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>. A key example is <span class="mathjax">$A[x_0, \ldots, x_n]$</span> or even <span class="mathjax">$A[x_0, \ldots, x_n]/I$</span> where <span class="mathjax">$I$</span> is a homogenous ideal with <span class="mathjax">$I \cap S_0 = 0$</span>. Here, we take conventional grading on <span class="mathjax">$A[x_0, \ldots, x_n]$</span> where each <span class="mathjax">$x_i$</span> has weight <span class="mathjax">$1$</span>. The subset <span class="mathjax">$S_+ := \oplus_i S_i \subset S_\bullet$</span> is an ideal, called the <mark>irrelevant ideal</mark>. If the irrelevant ideal <span class="mathjax">$S_+$</span> is finitely generated, we say that <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet$</span> is a finitely generated graded ring over <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>. If <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet$</span> is generated by <span class="mathjax">$S_1$</span> as an <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>-algebra, we say that <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet$</span> is generated in degree <span class="mathjax">$1$</span>.

        <p>
          We now define the scheme <span class="mathjax">$\text{Proj } S_\bullet$</span>, where <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet$</span> is a graded ring. Let us start with two instructive examples. If <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet = A[x_0, \ldots, x_n]$</span>, we will recover <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}_A^n$</span>; and if <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet = A[x_0, \ldots, x_n]/(f_0, \ldots, f_n)$</span>, where <span class="mathjax">$f$</span> is homogenous, we construct something cut out in <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}_A^n$</span> by <span class="mathjax">$f = 0$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we did with the spectrum of a ring, we will construct <span class="mathjax">$\text{Proj } S_\bullet$</span> first as a set, then as a topological space, and finally as a ringed space. As in our preliminary discussion, we will glue together <span class="mathjax">$n + 1$</span> well-chosen affine spaces, but we do it by considering all possible affine open sets. Our affine building blocks will be as follows. For each <span class="mathjax">$f \in S_+$</span>, note that the localization <span class="mathjax">$(S_\bullet)_f$</span> is naturally a <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{Z}$</span>-graded ring, where <span class="mathjax">$\text{deg}(1/f) = -\text{deg } f$</span>. Consider <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec }(((S_\bullet)_f)_0)$</span>, a zero-graded piece of the ring <span class="mathjax">$(S_\bullet)_f$</span>; the first and third subscripts refer to grading, and the second to localization. Applying this ring to <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet = k[x_0, \ldots, x_n]$</span> where <span class="mathjax">$f = x_i$</span>, we obtain the ring:<br/>
          $<span class="mathjax">$k[x_0/x_i, \ldots, x_n/x_i]/(x_i/x_i - 1)$</span>$
        </p>
        <p>
          The points of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Proj } S_\bullet$</span> are the set of homogenous prime ideals of <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet$</span> not containing the irrelevat ideal <span class="mathjax">$S_+$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The correspondence of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Proj } S_\bullet$</span> with homogenous prime ideals helps us picture <span class="mathjax">$\text{Proj } S_\bullet$</span>. For example, if <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet = k[x, y, z]$</span> with the usual grading, then we picture the homogenous prime ideal <span class="mathjax">$(z^2 - x^2 - y^2)$</span> first as the subset of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Spec } S_\bullet$</span>; it is a cone. We picture <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}_k^2$</span> as the plane at infinity. Thus, we picture this equation as cutting out a conic at infinity in <span class="mathjax">$\text{Proj } S_\bullet$</span>. If <span class="mathjax">$T$</span> is the set of homogenous elements of <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet$</span>, define the <mark>projective vanishing set</mark> <span class="mathjax">$V(T) \subset \text{Proj } S_\bullet$</span> to be those homogenous prime ideals containing <span class="mathjax">$T$</span>, but not <span class="mathjax">$S_+$</span>. Define <span class="mathjax">$V(f)$</span> if <span class="mathjax">$f$</span> is a homogenous element of positive degree, and <span class="mathjax">$V(I)$</span> if <span class="mathjax">$I$</span> is a homogenous ideal contained in <span class="mathjax">$S_+$</span>. Define <span class="mathjax">$D(f) := \text{Proj } S_\bullet \backslash V(f)$</span>, the <mark>projective distinguished open set</mark>, to be the complement of <span class="mathjax">$V(f)$</span>. Once we define a scheme structure on <span class="mathjax">$\text{Proj } S_\bullet$</span>, we will define <span class="mathjax">$D(f)$</span> to be, not just the open subset, but the open subscheme. As in the affine case, <span class="mathjax">$V(I)$</span>s satisfy the axioms for a closed set in topology, and we call this the <mark>Zariski topology</mark> on <span class="mathjax">$\text{Proj } S_\bullet$</span>. Many results about Zariski topology in the spectrum of a ring carry over with a little extra work. Clearly <span class="mathjax">$D(fg) = D(f) \cap D(g)$</span> by the same immediate argument as in the affine case.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now redefine the projective space over a ring <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> by <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}_A^n = \text{Proj } A[x_0, \ldots, x_n]$</span>. This definition involves no messing gluing or choice of patches. Note that projective coordinates <span class="mathjax">$x_0, \ldots, x_n$</span> is part of the definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          We call a scheme that is isomorphic to <span class="mathjax">$\text{Proj } S_\bullet$</span>, where <span class="mathjax">$S_\bullet$</span> is a finitely generated graded ring over <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>, a projective scheme over <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>, or a projective <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>-scheme. A quasiprojective <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>-scheme is a quasicompact open subscheme of a projecive <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>-scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the example of projectivization of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}V$</span>. Let <span class="mathjax">$V$</span> be an <span class="mathjax">$(n + 1)$</span>-dimensional vector space over <span class="mathjax">$k$</span>. Define:<br/>
          $<span class="mathjax">$\text{Sym}^\bullet V^\vee := k \oplus V^\vee \oplus \text{Sym}^2 V^\vee \oplus \ldots$</span>$
        </p>
        <p>
          If, for example, <span class="mathjax">$V$</span> is the dual of the vector space with basis associated to <span class="mathjax">$x_0, \ldots, x_n$</span>, we would have <span class="mathjax">$\text{Sym}^\bullet V^\vee = k[x_0, \ldots, x_n]$</span>. Then we can define <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{P}V = \text{Proj}(\text{Sym}^\bullet V^\vee)$</span>. In this language, <span class="mathjax">$x_0, \ldots x_n$</span> can be interpreted as linear functionals on the underlying vector space <span class="mathjax">$V$</span>. We can also describe a natural bijection between the points of <span class="mathjax">$V$</span> and closed points of <span class="mathjax">$\text{Proj}(\text{Sym}^\bullet V^\vee)$</span>. This construction respects the affine/projective cone picture.
