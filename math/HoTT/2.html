            Here, we discuss concepts from Ch.2 of the HoTT book
          </p>
          <p>
            The central idea is that types can be interpreted as higher-dimensional groupoids in category theory, or spaces in homotopy theory. Space $X$ is a set of points equipped with a topology, and a path betwen points $x$ and $y$ is represented by a continuous map $p : [0, 1] \rightarrow X$ where $p(0) = x, p(1) = y$. The function can be thought of as giving a point $x$ at each moment in time. A <mark>homotopy</mark> between a pair of continuous maps $H : X_1 \times [0, 1] \rightarrow X_2$, so that $H(s, 0) = p(s)$ and $H(s, 1) = q(s)$, can be thought of as a continuous deformation from $p$ to $q$.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <mark>fundamental group</mark> of a fundamental $\infty$-groupoid of a space will agree with the classical definition of a fundamental group of the space: this correspondence illustrates how homotopy theory and higher-dimensional category theory are intimately related.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will refer to $x =_A y$ as a path between the <mark>start point</mark> $x$ and <mark>endpoint</mark> $y$. $r : p =_{x =_A y} q$ can be thought of as a homotopy or a 2-path or 2-dimensional path. All of the basic constructions and axoims arises automatically from the induction principle for identity types. In other words, given the dependent funtions:
          </p>
          <ol class="olitems" type="i" start="1">
            <li>
              $D : \Pi_{x, y : A} (x = y) \rightarrow \mathscr{U}$
            </li>
            <li>
              $d : \Pi_{a : A} D(a, a, \texttt{refl}_a)$
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            there is a dependent function:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax full-bleed">
            $$
            ind_{=A}(D, d) : \Pi_{x, y : A} \Pi_{p : x = y} D(x, y, p)
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            such that
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax full-bleed">
            $$
            ind_{=A}(D, d, a, a, \texttt{refl}_a) \equiv d(a)
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            Informally, the induction principle for identity types says that if we want to construct an object which depends on an inhabitant $p : x =_A y$ of an identity type, then it suffices to perform the construction in the special case when $x, y$ are judgementally the same, and $p$ is the reflexivity element $\texttt{refl}_x x = x$.
          </p>
          <p>
            The induction principle endows each type with the structure of an $\infty$-groupoid, and each function between two types with the structure of the an $\infty$-functor betwen two such groupoids.

          <p class="exercise">
            To state our first lemma:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax full-bleed">
            $$
            \Pi_{A : \mathscr{U}} \Pi_{x, y : A} (x = y) \rightarrow (y = x)
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            The proof of this lemma would involve constructing an inhabitant of this type. Let us write the proof in an informal style, as this is preferred. We want to construct $x, y :A$, $p : x = y$, and $p^{-1} : y = x$. By induction, it suffices to consider the case when $y = x$ and $p = \texttt{refl}_x$. In this case, the type of $x = y$ and $y = x$, in which we're trying to construct $p^{-1}$, are both equal to $x = x$. Thus, in the reflexivity case, we can define $\texttt{refl}_x^{-1}$ to simply be $\texttt{refl}_x$. The general case therefore proceeds by the induction principle, and the conversion rule $\texttt{refl}_x^{-1} \equiv \texttt{refl}_x$.
          </p>
          <p class="exercise">
            To state our second lemma:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax full-bleed">
            $$
            \Pi_{A : \mathscr{U}} \Pi_{x, y, z : A} (x = y) \rightarrow (y = z) \rightarrow (x = z)
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            The proof proceeds as follows: $\forall x, y, z : A$, every $p : x = y$ and every $q : y = z$, we need to construct an inhabitant of $x = z$. By induction on $p$, it sufficces to assume that $y = x$ and $p$ is $\texttt{refl}_x$. In this case, the type of $y = z$ of $q$ is $x = z$. By induction on $q$, it suffices to assume that $z = x$ and $q$ is $\texttt{refl}_x$. In this case, $x = z$ is $x = x$, and we have $\texttt{refl}_x : (x = x)$.
          </p>
          <p>
            This proof raises the question of why an induction on $q$ is required at all, when we already have the equality $x = z$. Indeed, we could have done an induction on $p$ yielding the computation rule $p \circ \texttt{refl}_x \equiv p$, an induction on $q$ yielding the computation rule $\texttt{refl}_y \circ q \equiv q$, or, as above, induction on both $p$ and $q$, yeilding $\texttt{refl}_x \circ \texttt{refl}_x \equiv \texttt{refl}_x$. We would merely have three different elements of the same type.
          </p>
          <p class="exercise">
            We will now state some results without the obvious proofs. For $\Pi_{A : \mathscr{U}} \Pi_{x, y, z, w : A}$, $p : x = y$, $q : y = z$, $r : z = w$:
          </p>
          <ol class="olitems" type="i" start="1">
            <li>
              $p = p \circ \texttt{refl}_y$ and $p = \texttt{refl}_x \circ p$

            <li>
              $p^{-1} \circ p = \texttt{refl}_y$ and $p \circ p^{-1} = \texttt{refl}_x$

            <li>
              $(p^{-1})^{-1} = p$

              $(p \circ q) \circ r = p \circ (q \circ r)$

          </ol>
          <p>
            Given a type $A$ with point $a : A$, we define its loop space $\Omega(A, a)$ to be the type $a =_A a$; we could concatenate this to $\Omega A$ if $a$ is understood from the context. Since any two elements of $\Omega A$ are paths with the same start and endpoints, we have $\Omega A \times \Omega A \rightarrow \Omega A$. It can also be fruitful to consider the loop space of a loop space of $A$, the space of 2-dimensional loops, written $\Omega^2(A, a)$, represented as $\texttt{refl}_a =_{a =_A a} \texttt{refl}_a$.
          </p>
          <p class="exercise">
            The Eckmann-Hilton theorem can be stated as $\Omega^2(A) \times \Omega^2(A) \rightarrow \Omega^2(A)$ being commutative: $\alpha \circ \beta = \beta \circ \alpha$ for any $\alpha, \beta : \Omega^2(A)$.

            First, notice that $\Omega A \times \Omega A \rightarrow \Omega A$ induces an operation:

            Composing the two upper and lower paths, we get $p \circ r, q \circ s : a = c$. The horizontal composition can be written as $\alpha \star \beta : p \circ r = q \circ s$ defined as follows. First, we define $\alpha \circ_r r = p \circ_r = q \circ r$ by path induction on $r$ so that

          <p>
            where $\texttt{ru}_p = p \circ \texttt{refl}_b$ is the right unit lemma, which we previously mentioned. We can also define $q \circ_l \beta : q \circ r = q \circ s$ by induction on $q$ so that

            Next, since $\alpha \circ_r r$ and $q \circ_l \beta$ are composable 2-paths, we can define horizontal composition by:

            If $\Pi_{x : A} B(x)$ and $p : x = y$, then $f(x) : B(x)$ and $f(y) : B(y)$ are elements of distinct types, so that a priori, we cannot even ask whether they are equal. The misssing ingredient is that $p$ itself gives us a way to relate $B(x)$ and $B(y)$. This problem was stated as <mark>indiscrenability of identicals</mark> in our <a href="/HoTT/1#identity-types">previous note</a>.

            Sometimes, it is necessary to notate the type family $P$ in which the transport operation happens:

          <p class="mathjax full-bleed">

          </p>
          <p>
            Topologically, the transport lemma can be viewed as a "path lifting" operation on a fibration. We think of a type famiy $P : A \rightarrow \mathscr{U}$ as a fibration with base space $A$, with $P(x)$ being the fiber over $x$, and with $\Sigma_{x : A} P(x)$ being the <mark>total space</mark> of the fibration, with first projection $\Sigma_{x : A} P(x) \rightarrow A$.
          </p>
          <p>
            The defining property of a fibration is that given a path $p : x = y$ in the base space $A$ and a point $u : P(x)$ in a fiber over $x$, we may lift we may lift the path $p$ to a total space starting at $u$, and this lifting can be done continuously. The point $p_\star(u)$ can be thought of as the other endpoint of this lifted path.

          <p>
            In classical homotopy theory, a fibration is defined as a map for which there exist liftings of paths, while in contrast, we have shown that in type theory, every type family comes with a specified "lifting function".
          </p>
          <p>
            When the type family $P : A \rightarrow \mathscr{U}$ is regarded as a fibration, the base is $A$, and the total space is $\Sigma_{x : A} P(x)$. We may also refer to the dependent function $\Pi_{x : A} P(x)$ as the <mark>section</mark> of the fibration $P$, and we may say that something happens <mark>fiberwise</mark> if it happens for each $P(x)$. For instance, a section $f : \Pi_{x : A} P(x)$ shows that $P$ is "fiberwise inhabited".
          </p>
          <p>
            We can now prove a dependent version of the lemma $\texttt{ap}_f : (x =_A y) \rightarrow (f(x) =_B f(b))$ as follows. Given $\Pi_{x : A} P(x)$, we can define a non-dependent version of the function $f' : A \rightarrow \Sigma_{x : A} P(x)$ by setting $f'(x) :\equiv (x, f(x))$ and consider $f'(p) : f'(x) = f'(y)$. Since $\texttt{pr}_1 \circ f' \equiv \texttt{id}_A$, we have $\texttt{pr}_1(f'(p)) \equiv p$; thus $f'(p)$ does "lie over" $p$ in this sense. However, it is not obvious from the type of $f'(p)$ that it lies over any specific path in $A$ (in this case $p$), which is sometimes important.
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution is to use the transport lemma; we have a canonical path $\texttt{lift}(u, p)$ from $(x, u)$ to $(u, p_\star(u))$, which lies over $p$. Thus, any path from $u : P(x)$ to $v : P(y)$ lying over $p$ should factor through $\texttt{lift}(u, p)$.

If [f : forall a:A, B a] and [p : x = y] is a path in [A], then [apD f p] should somehow

we use transport along [p] to make them comparable: [apD f p : p # f x = f y].

            Given $f : A \rightarrow B$, a quasi-inverse of $f$ is a triple $(g, \alpha, \beta)$ consisting of a function $g : B \rightarrow A$ and homotopies $\alpha : f \circ g \sim \texttt{id}_B$ and $\beta : g \circ f \sim \texttt{id}_A$. The quasi-inverse of $f$ is denoted $\texttt{qinv}(f)$.

            In general, we will reserve the use of the term isomorphism in the special case when $A$ and $B$ behave like sets, where it is unproblematic. Let us define <mark>equivalence</mark> for an improved notation $isequiv(f)$ with the following properties:

            <li>
              Similarly, for each $f$, we have $\texttt{isequiv}(f) \rightarrow \texttt{qinv}$

            The higher groupoid structure of type formers
          </h2>
          <p>
            The goal now is to form new types corresponding to the type theoretic ones from our <a href="/HoTT/1">previous note</a>. For instance, a cartesian product $A = B \times C$, $x :\equiv (b, c)$, $y :\equiv (b', c')$, then we have:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax full-bleed">
            $$
            (b, c) = (b', c') \simeq (b = b') \times (c = c')
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            In more traditional language, two ordered pairs are equal just when their components are equal. The higher structure of identity types can also be expressed in terms of those equivalences. Similarly, when a type family $P : A \rightarrow \mathscr{U}$ is built up fiberwise, up to homotopy, in terms of the corresponding operations on the data that went into $P$. For instance, $P(x) = B(x) \times C(x)$. Then, we have:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax full-bleed">
            $$
            \texttt{transport}^P(p, (b, c)) = (\texttt{transport}^B(p, b), \texttt{transport}^C(p, c)
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, the type forming rules are also functorial, and if a function $f$ is built from this functorially, then the operations $\texttt{ap}_f$ and $\texttt{apd}_f$ can be computed based on the corresponding ones on the data going into into $f$. For instance, $g : B \rightarrow B'$ and $h : C \rightarrow C'$, and we define $f : B \times C \rightarrow B' \times C'$ by $f(b,c) :\equiv (g(b), h(c))$, then modulo equivalence, we can identify $\texttt{ap}_f$ with $(\texttt{ap}_g, \texttt{ap}_h)$.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since our philosophy states that identity types are defined uniformly for all types by their induction principle, so we cannot redefine them to be different for different types. The <a href="/HoTT/1">previous note</a> is insufficient to prove the desired theorems for two type formers: $\Pi$ types and universes. For $\Pi$ types, we use the axiom of <mark>functional extensionality</mark>, and for universes, we use the <mark>univalence axiom</mark>, which we will state shortly.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is, however, important to note that not all identity types can be determined by induction over the construction of types. Counterexamples include most non-trivial <mark>higher inductive types</mark> (HITs). For instance, calculating the identity types of types $\mathbb{S}^n$ is equivalent to calculating the higher homotopy groups of spheres, a field of research in algebraic topology.

            It's tempting to do this proof by $\mathbb{1}$-induction, but we'd get stuck and be unable to perform a path induction on $p : \star = \star$. A function $(x = y) \rightarrow \mathbb{1}$ is easy to define by sending everything to $\star$. We may assume, by path induction, that $x = y = \star$, in which case, we have $\texttt{refl}_\star : x = y$, yielding a constant function $\mathbb{1} \rightarrow (x = y)$. To show the inverses, consider an element $u : \mathbb{1}$, and safely assume that $u = \star$, but this is also the result of the composite $\mathbb{1} \rightarrow (x = y) \rightarrow \mathbb{1}$.

            Just as the type $a =_A a'$ is characterized upto isomorphism, with a separate definition for each $A$, there is no simple characterizion of the type $p =_{a =_A a'} q$ of paths between paths $p, q : a =_A a'$.

            To prove this, let $f^{-1}$ be a quasi inverse of $f$ with the homotopies:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax full-bleed">
            $$
            \alpha : \Pi_{b : B} f(f^{-1}(b)) = b \\
              \beta : \Pi_{a : A} f(f^{-1}(a)) = a
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            The quasi-inverse of $ap_f$ is essentially:

          <p class="mathjax full-bleed">
            $$
            \texttt{ap}_{f^{-1}} : (f(a) = f(a')) \rightarrow (f^{-1}(f(a)) = f^{-1}(f(a')))
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in order to obtain an element of $a =_A a'$ from $\texttt{ap}_{f^{-1}}(q)$ we must concatenate with $\beta_\alpha^{-1}$ and $\beta_{\alpha'}$ on either side. For $p : a =_A a'$ and $q : f(a) =_B f(a')$, we have:

          <p class="mathjax full-bleed">
            $$
            \beta_\alpha^{-1} \circ \texttt{ap}_f(\texttt{ap}_f(p)) \circ \beta_{\alpha'} = p \\
              \texttt{ap}_f(\beta_\alpha^{-1} \circ \texttt{ap}_{f^-1}(a) \circ \beta_{\alpha'}) = q
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            We can prove the latter by simply canceling inverse paths.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, for some type $A$, we have a full characterizion of $a =_A a'$ and the type $p =_{a_{=A}} q$ is determined as well. For example, paths $p = q$ where $p, q : f =_{\Pi_{x : A} B(x)} g$ are equivalent to homotopies:

          <p>
            Next, we consider transport in families of paths; ie.e. transport in $C : A \rightarrow \mathscr{U}$ where each $C(x)$ is an identity type.

            Since $\Sigma$ types are a generalization of cartesian product types, we can straightaway jump to the dependently typed version; if we have a type $X$ and type families $A : A \rightarrow \mathscr{U}$ and $P : \Pi_{x : A} A(x) \rightarrow \mathscr{U}$, then we have:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax full-bleed">
            $$
            (\Pi_{x : X} \Sigma_{x : A(x)} P(x, a)) \rightarrow (\Sigma_{g : \Pi_{x : A} A(x)} \Pi_{x : X} P(x, g(x)))
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that $\Sigma_{g : \Pi_{x : X} A(x)} \Pi_{x : X} P(x, g(x))$ can be read as "there exists a choice function $g : \Pi_{x : X} A(x)$ such that for all $x : X$, we have $P(x, g(x))$". The classical mathemtician may find that the axiom of choice doesn't carry its usual meaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of cartesian products, the non-dependent version simply expresses the <mark>cartesian closure adjuction</mark>:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax full-bleed">
            $$
            ((A \times B) \rightarrow C) \simeq (A \rightarrow (B \rightarrow C))
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            Some other induction principles are also part of universal properties of this sort. For instance, path induction is the right-to-left direction of an equivalence as follows:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax full-bleed">
            $$
            (\Pi_{x : A}\Pi_{p : a = x} B(x, p)) \simeq B(a, \texttt{refl}_a)
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            However, for inductive types with recursion, such as natural numbers, have more complicated universal properties, as we intend to describe later.
          </p>
          <p>
            As such, we have described the usual universal property of a cartesian product, but the reader may wonder about <mark>limits</mark> and <mark>colimits</mark> of types. For <mark>pullbacks</mark>, the expected explicit construction works; given $f: A \rightarrow C$ and $g : B \rightarrow C$, we define:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax full-bleed">
            $$
            A \times_C B :\equiv \Sigma_{a : A}\Sigma_{b : B} (f(a) = g(b))
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            For colimits, however, we need a new ingredient, which we will discuss later.
