          Topology is <span class="mathjax">$\{X, \tau\}$</span>, where <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> is a set and <span class="mathjax">$\tau$</span> is the set of subsets of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>; when unambiguous, <span class="mathjax">$\tau$</span> can be used to describe the toplogy. <span class="mathjax">$\tau$</span> satisfies the following properties:
        </p>
        <ol class="olitems" type="i" start="1">
          <li>

          Examples: <span class="mathjax">$\{X, \phi\}$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$\{X, \phi, \{a\}\}$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$\{X, \phi, \{a\}, \{a, b\}\}$</span> are examples of topologies, while <span class="mathjax">$\{X, \phi, \{a\}, \{b\}\}$</span> is an example of one that is not.

          Basis of a topology

        <p>
          The basis of a topology <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{B}$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$\{X, \tau\}$</span>, is defined as follows:
        </p>
        <ol class="olitems" type="i" start="1">
          <li>
            If <span class="mathjax">$x \in X$</span>, then <span class="mathjax">$\exists$</span> atleast one <span class="mathjax">$B$</span> such that <span class="mathjax">$x \in \mathscr{B}$</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If <span class="mathjax">$x \in \mathscr{B}_1 \cap \mathscr{B}_2$</span>, then <span class="mathjax">$\exists$</span> <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{B}_3 \subset \mathscr{B}_1 \cap \mathscr{B}_2$</span> containing <span class="mathjax">$x$</span>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Topology <span class="mathjax">$\tau$</span> is said to be generated by <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{B}$</span> as follows: <span class="mathjax">$U \in X$</span> is said to be open in <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> if <span class="mathjax">$\forall x \in U$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$\exists$</span> basis element <span class="mathjax">$B \in \mathscr{B}$</span> such that <span class="mathjax">$x \in B$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$B \subset U$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basis of a topology is not unique. We have described how to go from the basis to the topology it generates; for the reverse direction, one way of finding a basis of a topology of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{C}$</span> be a collection of open sets of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>. For each <span class="mathjax">$U \subset X$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$x \in U$</span>, there exists an element <span class="mathjax">$C$</span> of <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{C}$</span> such that <span class="mathjax">$x \in C \subset U$</span>. Then <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{C}$</span> is a basis for the topology of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>. To prove this: let <span class="mathjax">$x \in X$</span>, and since <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> is open, there exists, by hypothesis, an element <span class="mathjax">$C \in \mathscr{C}$</span> such that <span class="mathjax">$x \in C \subset X$</span>; this is enough to fulfill the first condition in the definition of a topology. For the second condition, let <span class="mathjax">$x \in C_1 \cap C_2$</span>, where <span class="mathjax">$C_1, C_2 \in \mathscr{C}$</span>. Since <span class="mathjax">$C_1, C_2$</span> are open, so is <span class="mathjax">$C_1 \cap C_2$</span>, and there exists, by hypothesis,  <span class="mathjax">$C_3 \in \mathscr{C}$</span>, such that <span class="mathjax">$x \in C_3 \subset C_1 \cap C_2$</span>. Let <span class="mathjax">$\tau$</span> be the collection of open sets in <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>; it remains to be shown that the topology <span class="mathjax">$\tau'$</span> generated by <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{C}$</span> equals <span class="mathjax">$\tau$</span>. First, note that if <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> belongs to <span class="mathjax">$\tau$</span>, then there exists, by hypothesis, an element <span class="mathjax">$C \in \mathscr{C}$</span> such that <span class="mathjax">$x \in C \subset U$</span>. It follows that <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> belongs to the topology <span class="mathjax">$\tau'$</span>, by definition. Conversely, if <span class="mathjax">$W$</span> belongs to <span class="mathjax">$\tau'$</span>, then <span class="mathjax">$W$</span> equals union of elements of <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{C}$</span>. Since each element of <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{C}$</span> belongs to <span class="mathjax">$\tau$</span>, so does <span class="mathjax">$W$</span>.

        <p>
          A <mark>subbasis</mark> <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{S}$</span> of a topological space <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> is defined as the collection of all subsets of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> whose union equals <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>. The topology generated by the subbasis is defined as the collection <span class="mathjax">$\tau$</span> of all unions of finite intersections of elements of <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{S}$</span>.

          Given <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span>, two topological spaces, the product topology <span class="mathjax">$X \times Y$</span> is defined as a collection <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{B}$</span> having as basis all subsets of the form <span class="mathjax">$U \times V$</span>, where <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> is an open subset of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>, and <span class="mathjax">$V$</span> is a an open subset of <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A property of product spaces is:
        </p>
        <div class="mathjax">
          $$
          (U_1 \times V_1) \cap (U_2 \times V_2) = (U_1 \cap U_2) \times (V_1 \cap V_2)

          If <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{B}$</span> is a basis for <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>, and <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{C}$</span> is a basis for <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span> being topological spaces, then the collection:

        </div>
        <p>
          is a basis for <span class="mathjax">$X \times Y$</span>. This can be proved as follows. Given an open set <span class="mathjax">$W$</span> of <span class="mathjax">$X \times Y$</span>, and a point <span class="mathjax">$x \times y \in W$</span>, by definition of product topology, there is a basis element <span class="mathjax">$U \times V$</span> such that <span class="mathjax">$x \times y \in U \times V \subset W$</span>. Because <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{B}, \mathscr{C}$</span> are bases of <span class="mathjax">$X, Y$</span>, we can choose an element <span class="mathjax">$B \in \mathscr{B}$</span> such that <span class="mathjax">$x \in B \subset U$</span>, and <span class="mathjax">$C \in \mathscr{C}$</span> such that <span class="mathjax">$y \in C \subset V$</span>. Then <span class="mathjax">$x \times y \in B \times C \subset W$</span>. Thus the collection <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{D}$</span> meets the criterion for being a basis of <span class="mathjax">$X \times Y$</span>.

          Given the topology <span class="mathjax">$(X, \tau)$</span> and a <span class="mathjax">$Y \subset X$</span>, the subspace topology <span class="mathjax">$\tau_Y$</span> is defined as:

        <p>
          If <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{B}$</span> is the basis for topology <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>, then <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{B}_Y = \{B \cap Y \mid B \in \mathscr{B}\}$</span> is a basis for the subspace topology on <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span>. We prove this as follows: Given <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> open in <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$y \in U \cap Y$</span>, we can choose <span class="mathjax">$B$</span> so that <span class="mathjax">$y \in B \subset U$</span>. Then, <span class="mathjax">$y \in B \cap Y \subset U \cap Y$</span>. It follows that <span class="mathjax">$\mathscr{B}_Y$</span> is the basis for the subpsace topology on <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span> be a subspace of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>. If <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> is open in <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span> is open in <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>, then <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> is open in <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>. To prove this, notice that, since <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span> is open in <span class="mathjax">$U$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$Y = U \cap V$</span>, for some open set <span class="mathjax">$V$</span> in <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>. Now, since both <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$V$</span> are open in <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>, so is <span class="mathjax">$U \cap V$</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$B$</span> are subspaces of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span>, then the product topology <span class="mathjax">$A \times B$</span> is the same as the topology <span class="mathjax">$A \times B$</span> one inherits as a subspace of <span class="mathjax">$X \times Y$</span>. To prove this, let <span class="mathjax">$U, V$</span> be the general basis element of <span class="mathjax">$X, Y$</span>, where <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> is open in <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$V$</span> is open in <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span>. We know that the general basis element for for the subspace topology of <span class="mathjax">$A \times B$</span> satisfies:
        </p>
        <div class="mathjax">
          $$
          (U \times A) \cap (V \times B) = (U \cap V) \times (A \cap B)
          $$
        </div>
        <p>
          So, <span class="mathjax">$(U \cap V) \times (A \cap B)$</span> is the general basis element for the product topology on <span class="mathjax">$A \times B$</span>. Since the bases for the product topology on <span class="mathjax">$A \times B$</span> and the subspace topology <span class="mathjax">$A \times B$</span> are the same, the topologies are the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> be an ordered set in the order topology, and <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span> be a subset. The resulting order topology on <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span> need not be the same as the topology <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span> inherits as a subspace of <span class="mathjax">$X$</span>.

          A subset <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> of a topological space <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> is said to be closed if <span class="mathjax">$X - A$</span> is open. As an example, consider the subset <span class="mathjax">$[a, b] \in \mathbb{R}$</span>. It is closed because <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{R} - [a, b] = (-\infty, a) \cup (b, +\infty)$</span> is open.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prove (i), notice that <span class="mathjax">$X, \phi$</span> are complements of open sets <span class="mathjax">$\phi, X$</span>, and are hence closed. To prove (ii), apply De-Morgan's law to a collection of closed sets <span class="mathjax">$\{A_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in J}$</span>:

        <div class="mathjax">

        </div>
        <p>
          Notice that the right hand side of this equation represents arbitary unions of open sets, and is hence open, since <span class="mathjax">$X - A_\alpha$</span> is open by definition. To prove (iii), apply De-Morgan's law again on closed sets <span class="mathjax">$A_j$</span>:
        </p>
        <div class="mathjax">
          $$

        </div>
        <p>
          The right side of this equation represents finite intersections of open sets and is therefore open. Hence, <span class="mathjax">$\bigcup A_j$</span> is closed.

Then, <span class="mathjax">$x$</span> is termed as the limit point of <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> if every neighborhood of <span class="mathjax">$x$</span> intersects <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> at some point other than <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>.

In <span class="mathjax">$A = (0, 1] \subset \mathbb{R}$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$1$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$\frac{1}{2}$</span> are limit points. Every point in <span class="mathjax">$[0, 1]$</span> is a limit point.

Since <span class="mathjax">$A \subset \bar{A}$</span> by definition, it follows that <span class="mathjax">$A \cup A' \subset \bar{A}$</span>. To demonstrate the reverse inclusion, let <span class="mathjax">$x \in \bar{A}$</span>, and show that <span class="mathjax">$x \in A \cup A'$</span>. If <span class="mathjax">$x \in A$</span>, this is trivial. If not, since <span class="mathjax">$x \in \bar{A}$</span>, we know that every neighborhood <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> of <span class="mathjax">$x$</span> intersects <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> different from <span class="mathjax">$x$</span>.

        <p>
          A topology <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> converges to the point <span class="mathjax">$x$</span>, if for each neighborhood <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> of <span class="mathjax">$x$</span>, there is a positive integer <span class="mathjax">$N$</span> such that <span class="mathjax">$x_n \in U$</span> for each <span class="mathjax">$n \geq N$</span>. In a general topology, we can have a sequence converging to more than one point; in order to disallow this non-intuitiveness, we define a Hausdorff space:
        </p>
        <p>
          A topological space <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> is Hausdorff if, for each pair of points <span class="mathjax">$x_1$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$x_2$</span>, the corresponding neighborhoods <span class="mathjax">$U_1$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$U_2$</span> are disjoint.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every finite point set in a Hausdorff space <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> is closed. The proof follows. It suffices to show that every one-point set <span class="mathjax">$\{x_0\}$</span> is closed. If <span class="mathjax">$x \in X$</span> is a point different from <span class="mathjax">$x_0$</span>, then <span class="mathjax">$x$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$x_0$</span> have disjoint neighborhoods <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$V$</span>. Since <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> does not intersect <span class="mathjax">$\{x_0\}$</span>, the point <span class="mathjax">$x$</span> cannot belong to the closure of the set <span class="mathjax">$\{x_0\}$</span>. As a result, the closure of <span class="mathjax">$\{x_0\}$</span> is <span class="mathjax">$\{x_0\}$</span> itself, so it is closed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <mark><span class="mathjax">$T_1$</span> axiom</mark>: every point set is closed; this is weaker than the Hausdorff condition and implies it. Our lack of interest in the <span class="mathjax">$T_1$</span> axiom is due to the fact that most interesting results require the full strength of the Hausdorff condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sequence of points of a Hausdorff space <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> converges to atmost one point. To prove this, suppose that <span class="mathjax">$x_n$</span> is a sequence of points in <span class="mathjax">$X$</span> that converges to <span class="mathjax">$x$</span>. If <span class="mathjax">$y \neq x$</span>, let <span class="mathjax">$U, V$</span> be disjoint neighborhoods of <span class="mathjax">$x, y$</span>. Since <span class="mathjax">$U$</span> contains <span class="mathjax">$x_n$</span> for all but finitely many points of <span class="mathjax">$n$</span>, the set <span class="mathjax">$V$</span> cannot. Hence, <span class="mathjax">$x_n$</span> cannot converge to <span class="mathjax">$y$</span>.

The closure of <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> in <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span> is <span class="mathjax">$\bar{A} \cap Y$</span>. Further, since <span class="mathjax">$A$</span> is closed in <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$A = \bar{A} \cap Y$</span> or <span class="mathjax">$\bar{A} \cap B = \phi$</span>. Since <span class="mathjax">$\bar{A} = A \cup A'$</span>, <span class="mathjax">$B$</span> contains no limit points of <span class="mathjax">$A$</span>. A similar argument holds for <span class="mathjax">$B$</span>. Conversely, suppose that <span class="mathjax">$A, B$</span> are disjoint nonempty subsets whose union is <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span>, neither of which contains the limit point of the other. Then, <span class="mathjax">$A \cap \bar{B} = \bar{A} \cap B = \phi$</span>; therefore <span class="mathjax">$\bar{A} \cap Y = A$</span> and <span class="mathjax">$\bar{B} \cap Y = B$</span>. Thus, <span class="mathjax">$A, B$</span> are closed in <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span>, and since <span class="mathjax">$A = Y - B, B = Y - A$</span>, they're open in <span class="mathjax">$Y$</span> as well.

          Examples: Let <span class="mathjax">$X = [0, 2]$</span> be a subspace of <span class="mathjax">$\mathbb{R}$</span>. <span class="mathjax">$[0, 1) \cup (1, 2]$</span> is separable, and hence disconnected. However, <span class="mathjax">$[0, 1) \cup [1, 2]$</span> is non-separable since the first set contains a limit point of the second, namely <span class="mathjax">$1$</span>.
