The capitalist wet dream

Capitalism works by getting a small number of skilled humans to produce something or offer some service that can then be marketed and sold to a vast consumer class. We live in very exciting times, for corporations have stumbled on a piece of technology that will take the capitalist wet dream to its absolute end: eliminating a vast number of skilled humans from the process, generating vast amounts of low-quality content instantaneously. Yes, generative AI will take jobs away from artists, writers, journalists, doctors, therapists, programmers, musicians, actors, lawyers, and several other professions. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying. Capitalism has always been a race to the bottom: if your product or service offers something valuable at a competitive price, consumers will give you their money. Amazon and Uber are prime examples of this, and both create a sharp divide between the workers they exploit and the customers who're paying them. Whatever happens next with generative AI should therefore come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the basics of capitalism.

In this race to the bottom, there will be a vast number of people who can't afford human labor and are stuck in the free tier of ad-supported AI-generated content. The amount of such content available will explode by five or ten orders of magnitude, leading to greater consumption, and hence higher ad revenues. Most ads in this tier will be similarly AI-generated, as advertisers would also want to cut costs. Of course, corporations will say that the vast majority's quality of life has improved, as these poor people would now have access to a free AI doctor, therapist, and companion, AI summaries of content they can't afford, in addition to the vast amounts of low-quality misinformation and entertainment. The number of skilled humans required will shrink, as will the output: for the average person, buying such content will become a luxury. Wealthy people today already live in separate worlds, and they're already a different class of consumer, so it's not very hard to imagine what the world will be like once this technology becomes widespread.

Lengthy articles and debates on the internet seriously evaluating generative AI technology amuse me. It's supposed to be cheap unglamorous rubbish that you peddle to the masses, and I'm sure the people making the calls at corporations are chuckling too.

AI is something you pay to avoid, just like ads. $\Box$
