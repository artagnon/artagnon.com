          Convention: \(A\) is used to denote a ring, \(A[T]\) is a polynomial ring. \((f) \subset A[T]\) is a polynomial. \(M\) is an A-module. \(I\) and \(J\) are ideals, \(V\) is a variety, \(\mathcal{V}\) is a Zariski topology. \(L\), \(M\), \(N\) are modules. \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bridge between algebra and geometry is established as follows: the maximal ideal \(A = k[x_1, \ldots, x_N]\) corresponds to points in \(X\).

        <h2>
          Ideals
        </h2>
        <p>
          An ideal \(I\) of \(A\) is defined to be a additive subgroup of \(A\) that is closed under multiplication with elements of \(A\); that is, \(Ia \in I \, \forall a \in A\). The `quotient ring` \(A/I\) inherits a uniquely defined multiplication from \(A\), making it into a subring, the quotient ring or the `residue-class ring`. \(\varphi : A \rightarrow A/I\) is a `ring homomorphism`, and it maps every \(x \in A\) to the `coset` \(x + I\).
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a one-to-one order-preserving correspondence between ideals \(J\) of \(A\) which contain \(I\), and ideals \(\bar{J}\) of \(A/I\), given by \(J = \varphi^{-1}(\bar{J})\). Notice that the kernel of the homomorphism \(f : A \rightarrow B\) is \(I\), image \(f(A)\) is a subring \(C \subseteq B\), and \(f\) induces the homomorphism \(A/I \cong C\).
        </p>
        <p>
          A `zero-divisor` of an element \(x \in A\) is, if it exists, an element \(y \neq 0 \implies xy = 0\). A ring with no zero-divisors is called an `integral domain`. A `unit` of an element \(x \in A\) is an element \(y : xy = 1\); then \(y = x^{-1}\). The units in \(A\) form a multiplicative abelian group, and a ring in which every element has an inverse is called a `field`; obviously every field is an integral domain. The multiples \(Ix, x \in A\) form the `principal ideal`, and is denoted by \((I)\).
        </p>
        <p>
          \(P\) is a `prime ideal` of \(A\) if \(P \neq (1)\) and \(xy \in P \implies x \in P \vee y \in P\) for \(x, y \in A\). \(M\) is a `maximal ideal` of \(A\) if \(M \neq (1)\), and there exists no ideal \(I\) strictly between \(M\) and \(A\), that is no \(I : M \subset I \subset A\). In \(A[x]\), prime ideals consist of \((0)\), maximals, and irreducibles.
        </p>

          Three elementary results (proved in [ra/hw](/ra/hw)):
        </p>
        <ol class="olitems" type="i" start="1">
          <li>
            \(M\) is maximal \(\iff A/M\) is a field.
          </li>
          <li>
            \(P\) is prime \(\iff A/P\) is an integral domain.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maximal ideal \(\implies\) prime ideal.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If \(f : A \rightarrow B\) is a ring homomorphism, and \(Q\) is a prime ideal of \(B\), then \(f^{-1}(Q)\) is a prime ideal of \(A\), for \(A/f^{-1}(Q)\) is isomorphic to a subring of \(B/Q\), and hence has no zero-divisors. But if \(N\) is a maximal ideal in \(B\), \(A/f^{-1}(N)\) need not be a maximal ideal in \(A\); all we can say is that it is prime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every ring \(A \neq 0\) has a maximal ideal, and this can be proved using `Zorn's lemma`. If \(A \neq (1)\) is an ideal of \(A\), then there is some maximal ideal containing \(A\). It follows that every non-unit of \(A\) is contained in some maximal ideal. A ring \(A\) with exactly one maximal ideal \(M\) is called a `local ring`, and the field \(A/M\) is called the `residue field`.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let \(A\) be a ring, then:
        </p>
        <ol class="olitems" type="i" start="1">
          <li>
            Let \(M\) be an ideal such that every \(x \in A - M\) is a unit in \(A\). Then, \(A\) is a local ring, and \(M\) is a maximal ideal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let \(M\) be a maximal ideal such that every \(1 + M \in A\) is a unit in \(A\). Then, \(A\) is a local ring.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          To prove (i), notice that every ideal \(\neq (1)\) consists of non-units and is hence contained within \(M\).
        </p>
        <p>
          To prove (ii), let \(x \in A - M\). Since \(M\) is maximal, the ideal generated by \(x\) and \(M\) is \((1)\), hence there exists \(m \in M, y \in A\) such that \(xy + m = 1\) or \(xy = 1 - m\); this is contained in \(1 + M\) and is hence unit.
        </p>
        <p>
          What follows is a bunch of examples:

        <ol class="olitems" type="i" start="1">
          <li>
            Let \(A = k[x_0, \ldots, x_n]\), the ring of polynomials. If \(f\) is an irreducible polynomial, then, by unique factorization, \((f)\) is a prime ideal. Similarly, if \(A\) is a ring of polynomials with constant term zero, then every ideal in \(A\) is a maximal ideal; it is the kernel of the homomorphism \(f : A \rightarrow k\), which maps every \(f \in A\) to \(f(0)\).
          </li>
          <li>
            Let \(A = \mathbb{Z}\) with ideals of the form \((m)\). Then \((m)\) is a prime ideal \(\iff\) \(m\) is prime number or \(0\). All prime ideals \((p)\) are maximal: \(A/(p)\) is a field.

            A `principal ideal domain` is an integral domain where all ideals are principal. In such a ring, every nonzero prime ideal is a maximal ideal.

          Nilradicals
        </h2>
        <p>
          The set of all nilpotent elements \(\mathfrak{N}\) of \(A\) is an ideal, and \(A/\mathfrak{N}\) does not have any nilpotent elements. To prove this, let \(x, y \in \mathfrak{N}\) be nilpotent elements of order \(m, n\). By the binomial theorem, \((x + y)^{m + n - 1}\) has terms of the form \(x^r y^s\); but we cannot have both \(r &lt; m\) and \(s &lt; n\), so each of these terms vanish, and \((x + y)^{m + n - 1} = 0, x + y \in \mathfrak{N}\). Let \(\bar{x^n} \in A/\mathfrak{N}\) be a representation of \(x^n\). Then \((x^n)^p = 0\), and \(x \in \mathfrak{N} \implies \bar{x} = 0\). Ideal \(\mathfrak{N}\) is called the `nilradical` of \(A\).
        </p>
        <p>
          The nilradical \(\mathfrak{N}\) of \(A\) is the intersection of all prime ideals of \(A\). To prove this, let \(\mathfrak{N}'\) be the intersection of prime ideals. If \(f \in A\) is nilpotent, and \(P\) is a prime ideal, \(f^n = 0 \in P\) for some \(n\), and hence \(f \in P\) (because \(P\) is prime) and \(f \in \mathfrak{N}'\). Conversely, suppose that \(f\) is not nilpotent. Let \(\Sigma\) be the set of ideals \(I\) such that \(n \gt 0 \implies f^n \notin I\). \(\Sigma\) is not zero, and by Zorn's lemma, there is some maximal element in \(\Sigma\). Let \(P\) be this maximal element: it remains to be shown that \(P\) is a prime ideal. Let \(x, y \notin P\), so \(P + (x), P + (y)\) contain \(P\), and therefore do not belong to \(\Sigma\). If:
          \[f^m = P + (x) \quad f^n = P + (y)\]
        </p>
        <p>
          then, \(f^{m + n} \in P + (xy)\), hence the ideal \(P + (xy) \notin \Sigma\), and \(xy \notin P\). Hence, we have a prime ideal \(P\), and \(f \notin P, f \notin \mathfrak{N}'\).
        </p>
        <p>
          The `Jacobson radical` \(\mathfrak{R}\) of \(A\) is defined to be the intersection of all maximal ideals of \(A\).
        </p>
        <p>
          \(x \in \mathfrak{R} \iff 1 - xy\) is a unit in \(A\) for all \(y \in A\). To prove this, let is first assume that \(1 - xy\) is not a unit. But \(1 - xy\) belongs to some maximal ideal \(M\); and \(x \in \mathfrak{R} \subseteq M\), so \(xy \in M\), and hence \(1 \in M\), which is absurd. To prove the converse, let \(x \notin M\), for some maximal ideal \(M\). Then, \(M\) and \(x\) generate \((1)\), and \(u + xy \in M\), for some \(u \in M, y \in A\). Hence, \(1 - xy \in M\) is not unit.

          Operations on ideals
        </h2>
        <p>
          The sum of two ideals \(I, J\), denoted \(I + J\), is the smallest set, \(x + y, x \in I, y \in J\), containing both ideals. The product, denoted \(IJ\) is the ideal generated by \(xy\). In \(\mathbb{Z}\), let \(I = (m), J = (n)\); then the sum \(I + J\) is the l.c.m of \(m, n\), and \(IJ\) is the h.c.f of \(m, n\). In this case, \(IJ = I \cap J \iff m, n\) are coprime; more generally, \((I + J)(I \cap J) = IJ\).
        </p>
        <p>
          In \(A = k[x_0, \ldots, x_n]\), we have the distributive law \(I (J + K) = IJ + IK\) as in the case of \(\mathbb{Z}\). However, unlike the \(\mathbb{Z}\) case,

          Certainly, this is true for \(n = 1\). It holds for \(n \gt 1\), if it holds for \(n - 1\). Let \(x_i \in I\) such that \(x_i \notin P_j, i \neq j\). If \(x_i \notin P_i\), we are done. Otherwise, \(x_i \in P_i\) for all \(i\). Consider an element \(y \in I_q\) such that \(y \notin P_q\). Hence, we have  \(I \not\subseteq P_q\).

But \(\prod_q x_q \notin P\), since \(P\) is prime. Hence, \(I_q \subseteq P\). Finally, if \(P = \bigcap_q I_q\), then \(P \subseteq I_q\), and hence \(P = I_q\), for some \(q\).

          Extensions and contractions
        </h2>
        <p>
          Let \(f : A \rightarrow B\) be a ring homomorphism. Then for ideal \(I\), \(f(I)\) is not necessarily an ideal in \(B\). We define `extension` \(I^e\) to be the set \(Bf(I)\), generated by \(B\). Alternatively, if \(J\) is an ideal of \(B\), then \(f^{-1}(J)\) is necessarily an ideal in \(A\), and this is termed `contraction` \(J^c\). We can hence factorize \(f\) as follows:
          \[A \xrightarrow{p} f(A) \xrightarrow{q} B\]
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, \(p\) is surjective and \(q\) is injective. For \(p\), the situation is very simple: there is a one-to-one correspondence between ideals of \(f(A)\) and ideals of \(A\) that contain \(\text{ker }(f)\), and prime ideals correspond to prime ideals. For \(q\), however, the situation is complicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, consider \(f : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}[i]\). Primes in \(\mathbb{Z}\) may not stay prime in \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\). In fact, \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) is a principal ideal domain, and the situation is as follows:

          Modules

          Modules let us do linear algebra on general rings, even non-commutative ones. For instances of non-commutative rings, there's no need to look further than matrices over \(\mathbb{R}\), the field of real numbers. Another instance of non-commutative algebra can be found in Quaternions, that have different properties when cycling clockwise and counter-clockwise. The ideal \(I\) and quotient ring \(A/I\) are both examples of modules.

          Submodule \(M'\) of \(M\) is a subgroup of \(M\) closed under multiplication by elements of \(A\). The abelian group \(M/M'\) inherits the \(A\)-module structure from \(M\), given by \(a(x + M') = ax + M'\). The \(A\)-module \(M/M'\) is termed `quotient` of \(M\) by \(M'\). There is a natural homomorphism between \(M\) and \(M/M'\), and this is an \(A\)-module homomorphism. There is a one-to-one order-preserving bijection from submodules of \(M\) containing \(M'\) and submodules of \(M''\), as in the case of ideals.
        </p>
        <p>
          If \(f : M \rightarrow N\) is an \(A\)-module homomorphism, then its kernel and image are also submodules defined by:

        <p class="mathjax">
          \[\text{Ker}(f) = \{x \in M \mid f(x) = 0\}\]

          Let \(M\) be a module, and let \(M_i\) be the family of submodules of \(M\). Then, the `direct sum` is defined as \(\sum M_i\), the smallest submodule of \(M\) containing all \(M_i\). \(\bigcap M_i\) is again a submodule.

          What follows is a result on modules:

          <li>
            For submodules \(M_1, M_2\), \((M_1 + M_2)/M_1 = M_2/(M_1 \cap M_2)\).

          To prove (i), define homomorphism \(\theta : L/N \rightarrow L/M\) by \(\theta(x + N) = x + M\). Then, \(\theta\) is a well-defined \(A\)-module homomorphism with kernel \(M/N\).
        </p>
        <p>
          To prove (ii), consider the composition \(M_2 \rightarrow M_1 + M_2 \rightarrow (M_1 + M_2)/M_1\). It is surjective with kernel \(M_1 \cap M_2\).
        </p>
        <p>
          We cannot define a product of submodules. However, we can define the product \(IM\), where \(I\) is an ideal. If \(N, P\) are two \(A\)-modules, we can define \(N : P\) as the set of all \(a \in A\) such that \(aP \subseteq N\); it is an ideal. In particular \((0 : M)\) is termed `annihilator`, and written as \(\text{Ann}(M)\). An \(A\)-module is `faithful` if \(\text{Ann}(M) = 0\); if \(\text{Ann}(M) = I\), then the \(A\)-module is faithful as an \((A/I)\)-module.

          If \(M = \sum_i Ax_i\), then the \(x_i\) are termed the set of `generators` of the module \(M\). This means that every element of \(M\) can be expressed as finite linear combinations (not necessarily unique) of \(x_i\)s with coefficients in \(A\). \(M\) is said to be `finitely generated` if this is the case.

          Direct sum and product

        <p>
          If \(M, N\) are modules, then their `direct sum` \(M \oplus N\) is defined as the pairs \((x, y)\) for \(x \in M, y \in N\). Sum and scalar multiplication are defined in the usual way:
          \[(x_1, y_1) + (x_2, y_2) = (x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2)\]
          \[a (x, y) = (ax, ay)\]
        </p>
        <p>
          More generally, we can define the direct sum as \(\bigoplus_{q \in Q} M_q\) to have elements in the family \((x_q)_{q \in Q}\). For a finite index set \(Q\), direct sum and `direct product`, \(\prod_{q \in Q} M_q\), are the same thing, but not otherwise.

          Suppose ring \(A\) is a direct product \(\prod_q A_q\), then the set of elements of \(A\) of the form \((0, \ldots a_q, \ldots 0)\) where \(a_q \in A\), form an ideal \(I_q\). This is not a subring in general, because it does not contain identity. By considering ring \(A\) as a module, we have its decomposition into the direct sum of ideals. Conversely, given a ideal decomposition of a ring:
          \[A = I_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus I_n\]
        </p>

A finitely generated \(A\)-module is therefore isomorphic \(A \oplus \ldots \oplus A\), with \(n\) summands, written as \(A^n\).

          \(M\) is a finitely generated \(A\) module \(\iff M\) is isomorphic to the quotient of \(A^n\) for some \(n \gt 0\). To prove this, let \(x_1, \ldots, x_n\) generate \(M\), and \(\varphi : A^n \rightarrow M\) be defined by \(\varphi(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = a_1 x_1 + \ldots + a_n x_n\). Then, \(\varphi\) is an \(A\)-module homomorphism onto \(M\) and \(M \cong A^n/\text{Ker}(\varphi)\). Conversely, if \(e_i = (0, \ldots, 1, \ldots, 0)\), with \(1\) being in the \(i^{\text{th}}\) place, then \(e_i\)s generate \(A^n\), and hence \(\varphi(e_i)\) generate \(M\).

          Let \(M\) be a finitely generated \(A\)-module, \(I\) be an ideal of \(A\), and \(\varphi\) be an \(A\)-module endomorphism such that \(\varphi(M) \subseteq IM\). Then,
          \[\varphi^n + a_1 \varphi^{n - 1} + \ldots + a_n = 0\]
        </p>
        <p>
          where \(a_q \in I\). To prove this, let \(x_1, \ldots, x_n\) be the generators of \(M\). Then, each \(\varphi(x_q) \in IM\), so that \(\varphi(x_q) = \sum_{r = 1}^n a_{qr} x_r\). That is:
          \[\sum_{r = 1}^n (\delta_{qr} \varphi - a_{qr}) x_r = 0\]
        </p>
        <p>
          where \(\delta_{qr}\) is the Kronecker delta. Multiplying on the left by the adjoint of the matrix \((\delta_{qr} \varphi - a_{qr})\), we see that \(\text{det}(\delta_{qr} \varphi - a_{qr})\) annihilates each \(x_i\); expanding out this determinant gives us the required result.

          Nakayama's lemma, corollary: Let \(M\) be a finitely generated \(A\)-module, and \(I\) be an ideal in \(A\).

To prove this, notice that we have \(xM = 0\) for some \(x \equiv 1 \text{ mod } \mathfrak{R}\), by the corollary. But \(x\) is a unit in \(A\), and hence \(M = x^{-1}xM = 0\).

          Let \(A\) be a local ring, \(M\) its maximal ideal, \(k = A/M\) its residue field, and \(N\) a finitely generated module.

Then, \(x_i\)s generate \(N\). To prove this, let \(S\) be the submodule of \(N\) generated by \(x_i\), so it remains to be shown that \(S = N\). The composite \(S \rightarrow N \rightarrow N/MN\) maps \(S\) onto \(N/MN\), and hence \(S + MN = 1\), and \(N = S\).

The mapping \(f : M \times N \rightarrow P\) is said to be \(A\)-bilinear if, for each \(x \in M, y \in N\), the mapping \(y \rightarrow (x, y)\) of \(N\) onto \(P\), and the mapping \(x \rightarrow (x, y)\) of \(M\) onto \(P\), are both \(A\)-linear.
        </p>
        <p>
          We construct an \(A\)-module \(T\), called the `tensor product`, if the \(A\)-bilinear mapping \(M \times N \rightarrow P\) is in one-to-one correspondence with \(A\)-linear mappings \(T \rightarrow P\), for all \(A\)-modules \(P\). More precisely, there exists a pair \((T, g)\) consisting of \(A\)-module \(T\) and \(A\)-bilinear mapping \(g : M \times N \rightarrow T\), such that \(f = f' \circ g\), where \(f' : T \rightarrow P\) is a unique \(A\)-linear mapping. In other words, every mapping \(M \times N\) factors uniquely through \(T\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that tensor product notation \(x \otimes y\) is ambiguous; it may be zero in \(M' \times N'\), submodules of \(M, N\), while being zero in modules \(M, N\). For example, consider \(M = \mathbb{Z}, N = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}, M' =\) submodule \(2 \mathbb{Z}\) of \(\mathbb{Z}\) while \(N' = N\). Then, \(2 \otimes x = 1 \otimes 2x = 1 \otimes 0 = 0\), but is nonzero as an element of \(M' \otimes N'\).

        <p>
          Let \(x_i \in M, y_i \in N\), and \(\sum x_i \otimes y_i = 0\) in \(M \times N\). Then, there exist finitely generated submodules \(M_0, N_0\) of \(M, N\) such that \(\sum x_i \otimes y_i = 0\) in \(M_0 \otimes N_0\). To prove this, consider \(\sum (x_i, y_i) = D\); then \(\sum (x_i, y_i)\) is a finite sum of generators of \(D\). Let \(M_0\) be the submodule of \(M\) generated by the \(x_i\) and all the elements of \(M\) that occur as the first coordinates in these generators of \(D\). Define \(N_0\) similarly. Then, \(\sum x_i \otimes y_i = 0\) in \(M \times N\), as required.

Then \(M \otimes_A P\) is naturally a \(B\)-module, \(N \otimes_B P\) is an \(A\)-module, and we have:

Then, \((f' \circ f) \otimes (g' \circ g)\) and \((f' \otimes g') \circ (f \otimes g)\) agree on all elements of the form \(x \otimes y\) in \(M \otimes N\). Since the elements generate \(M \otimes N\), it follows that:
