Homotopy Type Theory: The essentials

...
Here, we discuss concepts from Ch.2 of the HoTT book
...

The central idea is that types can be interpreted as higher-dimensional groupoids in category theory, or spaces in homotopy theory. Space $X$ is a set of points equipped with a topology, and a path betwen points $x$ and $y$ is represented by a continuous map $p : [0, 1] \rightarrow X$ where $p(0) = x, p(1) = y$. The function can be thought of as giving a point $x$ at each moment in time. A `homotopy` between a pair of continuous maps $H : X_1 \times [0, 1] \rightarrow X_2$, so that $H(s, 0) = p(s)$ and $H(s, 1) = q(s)$, can be thought of as a continuous deformation from $p$ to $q$.

The `fundamental group` of a fundamental $\infty$-groupoid of a space will agree with the classical definition of a fundamental group of the space: this correspondence illustrates how homotopy theory and higher-dimensional category theory are intimately related.

We will refer to $x =_A y$ as a path between the `start point` $x$ and `endpoint` $y$. $r : p =_{x =_A y} q$ can be thought of as a homotopy or a 2-path or 2-dimensional path. All of the basic constructions and axoims arises automatically from the induction principle for identity types. In other words, given the dependent funtions:

(i) $D : \Pi_{x, y : A} (x = y) \rightarrow \mathscr{U}$
(ii) $d : \Pi_{a : A} D(a, a, \texttt{refl}_a)$

there is a dependent function:

$$
  ind_{=A}(D, d) : \Pi_{x, y : A} \Pi_{p : x = y} D(x, y, p)
$$

such that

$$
  ind_{=A}(D, d, a, a, \texttt{refl}_a) \equiv d(a)
$$

Informally, the induction principle for identity types says that if we want to construct an object which depends on an inhabitant $p : x =_A y$ of an identity type, then it suffices to perform the construction in the special case when $x, y$ are judgementally the same, and $p$ is the reflexivity element $\texttt{refl}_x x = x$.

The induction principle endows each type with the structure of an $\infty$-groupoid, and each function between two types with the structure of the an $\infty$-functor betwen two such groupoids.

# Types are higher groupoids

+ To state our first lemma:

$$
  \Pi_{A : \mathscr{U}} \Pi_{x, y : A} (x = y) \rightarrow (y = x)
$$

The proof of this lemma would involve constructing an inhabitant of this type. Let us write the proof in an informal style, as this is preferred. We want to construct $x, y :A$, $p : x = y$, and $p^{-1} : y = x$. By induction, it suffices to consider the case when $y = x$ and $p = \texttt{refl}_x$. In this case, the type of $x = y$ and $y = x$, in which we're trying to construct $p^{-1}$, are both equal to $x = x$. Thus, in the reflexivity case, we can define $\texttt{refl}_x^{-1}$ to simply be $\texttt{refl}_x$. The general case therefore proceeds by the induction principle, and the conversion rule $\texttt{refl}_x^{-1} \equiv \texttt{refl}_x$.

+ To state our second lemma:

$$
  \Pi_{A : \mathscr{U}} \Pi_{x, y, z : A} (x = y) \rightarrow (y = z) \rightarrow (x = z)
$$

The proof proceeds as follows: $\forall x, y, z : A$, every $p : x = y$ and every $q : y = z$, we need to construct an inhabitant of $x = z$. By induction on $p$, it sufficces to assume that $y = x$ and $p$ is $\texttt{refl}_x$. In this case, the type of $y = z$ of $q$ is $x = z$. By induction on $q$, it suffices to assume that $z = x$ and $q$ is $\texttt{refl}_x$. In this case, $x = z$ is $x = x$, and we have $\texttt{refl}_x : (x = x)$.

This proof raises the question of why an induction on $q$ is required at all, when we already have the equality $x = z$. Indeed, we could have done an induction on $p$ yielding the computation rule $p \circ \texttt{refl}_x \equiv p$, an induction on $q$ yielding the computation rule $\texttt{refl}_y \circ q \equiv q$, or, as above, induction on both $p$ and $q$, yeilding $\texttt{refl}_x \circ \texttt{refl}_x \equiv \texttt{refl}_x$. We would merely have three different elements of the same type.
