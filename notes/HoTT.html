            Here, we discuss concepts from Ch.2 of the HoTT book
          </p>
          <p>
            The central idea is that types can be interpreted as higher-dimensional groupoids in category theory, or spaces in homotopy theory. Space $X$ is a set of points equipped with a topology, and a path betwen points $x$ and $y$ is represented by a continuous map $p : [0, 1] \rightarrow X$ where $p(0) = x, p(1) = y$. The function can be thought of as giving a point $x$ at each moment in time. A `homotopy` between a pair of continuous maps $H : X_1 \times [0, 1] \rightarrow X_2$, so that $H(s, 0) = p(s)$ and $H(s, 1) = q(s)$, can be thought of as a continuous deformation from $p$ to $q$.
          </p>
          <p>
            The `fundamental group` of a fundamental $\infty$-groupoid of a space will agree with the classical definition of a fundamental group of the space: this correspondence illustrates how homotopy theory and higher-dimensional category theory are intimately related.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will refer to $x =_A y$ as a path between the `start point` $x$ and `endpoint` $y$. $r : p =_{x =_A y} q$ can be thought of as a homotopy or a 2-path or 2-dimensional path. All of the basic constructions and axoims arises automatically from the induction principle for identity types. In other words, given the dependent funtions:
          </p>
          <ol class="olitems" type="i" start="1">
            <li>
              $D : \Pi_{x, y : A} (x = y) \rightarrow \mathscr{U}$
            </li>
            <li>
              $d : \Pi_{a : A} D(a, a, \texttt{refl}_a)$
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            there is a dependent function:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax">
            $$
            ind_{=A}(D, d) : \Pi_{x, y : A} \Pi_{p : x = y} D(x, y, p)
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            such that
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax">
            $$
            ind_{=A}(D, d, a, a, \texttt{refl}_a) \equiv d(a)
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            Informally, the induction principle for identity types says that if we want to construct an object which depends on an inhabitant $p : x =_A y$ of an identity type, then it suffices to perform the construction in the special case when $x, y$ are judgementally the same, and $p$ is the reflexivity element $\texttt{refl}_x x = x$.
          </p>
          <p>
            The induction principle endows each type with the structure of an $\infty$-groupoid, and each function between two types with the structure of the an $\infty$-functor betwen two such groupoids.
          </p>

            Types are higher groupoids

          <p class="exercise">
            To state our first lemma:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax">
            $$
            \Pi_{A : \mathscr{U}} \Pi_{x, y : A} (x = y) \rightarrow (y = x)
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            The proof of this lemma would involve constructing an inhabitant of this type. Let us write the proof in an informal style, as this is preferred. We want to construct $x, y :A$, $p : x = y$, and $p^{-1} : y = x$. By induction, it suffices to consider the case when $y = x$ and $p = \texttt{refl}_x$. In this case, the type of $x = y$ and $y = x$, in which we're trying to construct $p^{-1}$, are both equal to $x = x$. Thus, in the reflexivity case, we can define $\texttt{refl}_x^{-1}$ to simply be $\texttt{refl}_x$. The general case therefore proceeds by the induction principle, and the conversion rule $\texttt{refl}_x^{-1} \equiv \texttt{refl}_x$.
          </p>
          <p class="exercise">
            To state our second lemma:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax">
            $$
            \Pi_{A : \mathscr{U}} \Pi_{x, y, z : A} (x = y) \rightarrow (y = z) \rightarrow (x = z)
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            The proof proceeds as follows: $\forall x, y, z : A$, every $p : x = y$ and every $q : y = z$, we need to construct an inhabitant of $x = z$. By induction on $p$, it sufficces to assume that $y = x$ and $p$ is $\texttt{refl}_x$. In this case, the type of $y = z$ of $q$ is $x = z$. By induction on $q$, it suffices to assume that $z = x$ and $q$ is $\texttt{refl}_x$. In this case, $x = z$ is $x = x$, and we have $\texttt{refl}_x : (x = x)$.
          </p>
          <p>
            This proof raises the question of why an induction on $q$ is required at all, when we already have the equality $x = z$. Indeed, we could have done an induction on $p$ yielding the computation rule $p \circ \texttt{refl}_x \equiv p$, an induction on $q$ yielding the computation rule $\texttt{refl}_y \circ q \equiv q$, or, as above, induction on both $p$ and $q$, yeilding $\texttt{refl}_x \circ \texttt{refl}_x \equiv \texttt{refl}_x$. We would merely have three different elements of the same type.
          </p>
          <p class="exercise">
            We will now state some results without the obvious proofs. For $\Pi_{A : \mathscr{U}} \Pi_{x, y, z, w : A}$, $p : x = y$, $q : y = z$, $r : z = w$:
          </p>
          <ol class="olitems" type="i" start="1">
            <li>
              $p = p \circ \texttt{refl}_y$ and $p = \texttt{refl}_x \circ p$
            </li>
            <li>
              $p^{-1} \circ p = \texttt{refl}_y$ and $p \circ p^{-1} = \texttt{refl}_x$
            </li>
            <li>
              $(p^{-1})^{-1} = p$
            </li>
            <li>
              $(p \circ q) \circ r = p \circ (q \circ r)$
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Given a type $A$ with point $a : A$, we define its loop space $\Omega(A, a)$ to be the type $a =_A a$; we could concatenate this to $\Omega A$ if $a$ is understood from the context. Since any two elements of $\Omega A$ are paths with the same start and endpoints, we have $\Omega A \times \Omega A \rightarrow \Omega A$. It can also be fruitful to consider the loop space of a loop space of $A$, the space of 2-dimensional loops, written $\Omega^2(A, a)$, represented as $\texttt{refl}_a =_{a =_A a} \texttt{refl}_a$.
          </p>
          <p class="exercise">
            The Eckmann-Hilton theorem can be stated as $\Omega^2(A) \times \Omega^2(A) \rightarrow \Omega^2(A)$ being commutative: $\alpha \circ \beta = \beta \circ \alpha$ for any $\alpha, \beta : \Omega^2(A)$.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, notice that $\Omega A \times \Omega A \rightarrow \Omega A$ induces an operation:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax">
            $$
            \star : \Omega^2(A) \times \Omega^2(A) \rightarrow \Omega^2(A)

          </p>
          <p>
            In the following diagram,
            $$
              \begin{matrix}
                p : a = b &amp; q : a = b \\
                r : b = c &amp; s : b = c \\
                \alpha : p = q &amp; \beta : r = s
              \end{matrix}
            $$
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax">

              \begin{xy}
              \xymatrix{
            
            & \ar@{=>}[dd]_\alpha && \ar@{=>}[dd]_\beta & \\
              a \ar@/^3pc/[rr]^p\ar@/_3pc/[rr]_q && b \ar@/^3pc/[rr]^r\ar@/_3pc/[rr]_s && c \\

              }

            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            Composing the two upper and lower paths, we get $p \circ r, q \circ s : a = c$. The horizontal composition can be written as $\alpha \star \beta : p \circ r = q \circ s$ defined as follows. First, we define $\alpha \circ_r r = p \circ_r = q \circ r$ by path induction on $r$ so that
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax">
            $$
            \alpha \circ_r \texttt{refl}_b \equiv \texttt{ru}_p^{-1} \circ \alpha \circ \texttt{ru}_q
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            where $\texttt{ru}_p = p \circ \texttt{refl}_b$ is the right unit lemma, which we previously mentioned. We can also define $q \circ_l \beta : q \circ r = q \circ s$ by induction on $q$ so that
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax">
            $$
            \texttt{refl}_b \circ_l \beta \equiv \texttt{lu}_r^{-1} \circ \beta \circ \texttt{lu}_s
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            where $\texttt{lu}_r$ denotes the left unit law. The operations $\circ_l$ and $\circ_r$ are called `whiskering`. Next, since $\alpha \circ_r r$ and $q \circ_l \beta$ are composable 2-paths, we can define horizontal composition by:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax">
            $$
            \alpha \star \beta :\equiv (\alpha \circ_r r)(q \circ_l \beta)
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, suppose that $a \equiv b \equiv c$ so that all paths $p, q, r, s$ are elements of $\Omega(A, a)$, and assume moreover that $p \equiv q \equiv r \equiv s \equiv \texttt{refl}_a$, so that $\alpha : \texttt{refl}_a = \texttt{refl}_a$ and $\beta : \texttt{refl}_a = \texttt{refl}_a$ are composable in both orders. In this case, we have:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax">
            $$
            \alpha \star \beta = \alpha \circ \beta = \alpha \star' \beta = \beta \circ \alpha
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            The foregoing fact, known as the `Eckmann-Hilton argument` comes from classical homotopy theory and is used later to show that higher homotopy groups of a type are always abelian groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            A `pointed type` $(A, a)$ is a type $A : \mathscr{U}$ together with a point $a : A$ called its `basepoint`. We write $\mathscr{U}_\bullet :\equiv \Sigma_{A : \mathscr{U}}$ for the type of pointed types in universe $\mathscr{U}$.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given a pointed type $(A, a)$, we can define the `loop space` of $(A, a)$ to be the following pointed type:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax">
            $$
            \Omega(A, a) :\equiv ((a =_A a), \texttt{refl}_a)
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            An element of it will be called a `loop` at a. For $n : \mathbb{N}$, the `n-fold iterated loop space` $\Omega^n(A, a)$ of a pointed type $(A, a)$ is defined recursively by:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax">
            $$
            \Omega^0(A, a) :\equiv (A, a) \\
              \Omega^{n + 1}(A, a) :\equiv \Omega^n(\Omega(A, a))
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            An element of it will be called an `n-loop` at $a$.

            From a type theoretic perspective, functions should respect equality; topologically, this corresponds to saying that every function is continuous (or preserves paths).

          <p class="exercise">

            $\texttt{ap}_f$ can be read as the application of a function to a path.
          </p>
          <p>
            To provide a simple proof, it suffices to assume that $p$ is $\texttt{refl}_x$. In this case, we may define $\texttt{ap}_f(p) :\equiv \texttt{refl}_{f(x)} f(x) = f(x)$. We will often write $\texttt{ap}_f(p)$ as $f(p)$, and this matches the common category theory convention of using the same symbol for application of a functor to objects and morphisms.

          <p class="exercise">
            We will now provide some facts about $\texttt{ap}_f$ without proof.

The misssing ingridient is that $p$ itself gives us a way to relate $B(x)$ and $B(y)$.

          </p>
          <p class="mathjax">
            $$
            \texttt{transport}^P(p, -) : P(x) \rightarrow P(y)
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            Topologically, the transport lemma can be viewed as a "path lifting" operation on a fibration. We think of a type famiy $P : A \rightarrow \mathscr{U}$ as a fibration with base space $A$, with $P(x)$ being the fiber over $x$, and with $\Sigma_{x : A} P(x)$ being the `total space` of the fibration, with first projection $\Sigma_{x : A} P(x) \rightarrow A$.
          </p>
          <p>
            The defining property of a fibration is that given a path $p : x = y$ in the base space $A$ and a point $u : P(x)$ in a fiber over $x$, we may lift we may lift the path $p$ to a total space starting at $u$, and this lifting can be done continuously. The point $p_\star(u)$ can be thought of as the other endpoint of this lifted path.
          </p>
          <p class="exercise">
            We now state `path lifting property` without proof. Let $P : A \rightarrow \mathscr{U}$ be a type family over $A$, and assume we have $u : P(x)$ for some $x : A$. Then, for $p : x = y$, we have:
          </p>
          <p class="mathjax">
            $$
            \texttt{lift}(u, p) : (x, y) = (y, p_\star(u))
            $$
          </p>
          <p>
            in $\Sigma_{x : A} P(x)$, such that $\texttt{pr}_1(\texttt{lift}(u, p)) = p$.
