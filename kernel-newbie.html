        <h1>Tales from a kernel newbie</h1>
        <p>So I returned $HOME on the 7th of September 2013. Ever since, I&#39;ve
          been attempting to build Linux. I got the binary build done pretty
          quickly, and now have to delve into the sources. The especially
          problematic architecture is talking between aarch64 (ARM 64-bit) and
          alpha. Since the ordering guarantees are very weak at the hardware
          level, the software must reorder agressively in order to
          optimize. I&#39;ve also taken recent interest in user-mode Linux (ARCH=um)
          and rebootless kernel upgrades. VFS has been built sufficiently with
          the help of my grandad and dad, and the filesystem has been changed to
          XFS.</p>
        <p>Need to tinker with kbuild, hwmon, and ALSA drivers at this
          point. Since I&#39;ve taken up a job with nobody in particular, I&#39;ll
          retire ARCH=alpha temporarily and work on aarch64. The base platforms
          are x86: i686 and x86_64. Will stay in this gray mode for some time to
          come, and contribute. Having finally made contact with Junio and Greg
          k-h, I&#39;m happy that git and linux are finally able to see one another;
          I might be the first one to have built an effective arch.</p>
        <p>Linus is a brilliant orchestrator. I&#39;ll get to spend time with my
          family and contribute a lot: I look forward to life.
