          On research, quantum computers, and AI

        <p>
          My professor here draws a line between what he calls &quot;advanced
          development&quot; and &quot;research&quot;. I&#39;m on the side of advanced
          development. It&#39;s the kind that takes a long time to become competent
          in; its focus is on building something useful with many small bits of
          novelty, as opposed to something that&#39;s directly useless, but with one
          big novel jump. In general, I get the impression that university looks
          down on anything &quot;less&quot; than pure research. Quantum computing is a hot
          research topic now, but I wouldn&#39;t want to work on the problem yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quantum computers are about a decade away. When I say quantum
          computers, I actually mean computers with quantum accelerators: pure
          quantum computers are useless for general-purpose tasks. Computer
          architecture is going to change quite drastically as we reach the
          limits of silicon; new materials and fabrication technology is
          required. Perhaps carbon. But it definitely involves photonics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Computer architecture is is also changing at higher levels with
          introduction of processor extensions. These are incremental
          improvements, and are driven directly by needs: wouldn&#39;t qualify as
          &quot;research&quot;. There are software challenges to adapt to this new
          hardware, especially in the field of compilers and operating
          systems. Working on software wouldn&#39;t be as interesting if hardware
          didn&#39;t change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once quantum accelerators are out, there&#39;ll be a lot of
          design-from-scratch challenges. Perhaps it&#39;ll give us the acceleration
          required to perform complex machine learning tasks. The race towards
          building a conscious machine continues, but nobody really knows what
          that means. &quot;Godel, Escher, Bach&quot; hints that consciousness is simply a
          complex enough system of machine learning algorithms. I suspect more
          insights into the matter will come from neuroscience.
