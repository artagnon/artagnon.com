linux: user-mode linux defconfig

arch/um/defconfig only lists one default configuration, and that applies
only to the i386 architecture.  Replace it with two minimal
configuration files generated using `make savedefconfig`:

  i386_defconfig and x86_64_defconfig

The build scripts now require two updates:

1. um's Kconfig (arch/x86/um/Kconfig) should specify an ARCH_DEFCONFIG
   section explicitly pointing to these scripts if the required
   variables are set.  Take care to remove the DEFCONFIG_LIST section
   defined in the included file arch/um/Kconfig.common.

2. um's Makefile (arch/um/Makefile) should set KBUILD_DEFCONFIG properly
   for the top-level Makefile to pick up.  Copy the logic in
   arch/x86/Makefile to properly pick the defconfig file depending on
   the actual architecture; except we're working with $SUBARCH here,
   instead of $ARCH.

Now, you can do:

    $ ARCH=um make defconfig
    $ ARCH=um make

and successfully build User-Mode Linux on an x86_64 box in default
configuration.
