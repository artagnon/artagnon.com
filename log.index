Log

This is not a blog.  Think of it as a recent snapshot of me: it
comprises of recent pieces of text that I wrote in various contexts.
I remove old content periodically.

If you're interested in discussing something with me (commenting), you
should email me.  If you're interested in more content like this,
consider following me on Twitter/ Plus.
