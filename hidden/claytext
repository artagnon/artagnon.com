How to write content for clayoven

(This is a header.  The first line enclosed in parentheses.)

Welcome.  Let me describe how to write content for clayoven [1].  Care
has been taken to ensure that the input [2] and output (i.e. this
page) are as close to each other as possible.

Paragraphs can be written as you would write them in emails, wrapped
to 80 characters.  Hard line-breaks will be removed and the html page
will wrap lines.

Links are footnoted, and cannot be inlined: this is a feature.

Lists are automatic.

1. This is an ordered list.
2. This is the second item.

- This is an unordered list.
- This is another ul item.

  This is a simple paragraph indent.

That's about it.  I really don't need anything else.
