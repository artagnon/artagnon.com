          Scholars vary in whether they identify the GPL as a contract or a
          non-contractual license.  In the non-contractual interpretation, if
          the licensee fails to abide by the terms of the GPL, no contract has
          been breached.  Violating the GPL, under this view, is no different
          from violating a fishing license by catching too many fish: you lose
          your license and pay a fine, but you do not surrender your fish to the
          licensor.  The FSF denies that the GPL can be used to &quot;force&quot;
          proprietary software to become open source by relying on this
          interpretation: There is no provision in the Copyright Act to require
          distribution of infringing work on altered terms.  A defendant found
          to have wrongfully included GPL-licensed code in his own proprietary
          work can be mulcted in damages for the distribution that has already
          occurred, and prevented from distributing his product further.
        </p>

          Under the contractual interpretation, however, there is nothing to
          stop the plaintiff from seeking an extreme remedy.  Ofcourse, the
          court might only award damages in the case of a not-so-major GPL
          violation.
