        <h1>On GPL enforcement</h1>
        <pre>Scholars vary in whether they identify the GPL as a contract or a
non-contractual license.  In the non-contractual interpretation, if
the licensee fails to abide by the terms of the GPL, no contract has
been breached.  Violating the GPL, under this view, is no different
from violating a fishing license by catching too many fish: you lose
your license and pay a fine, but you do not surrender your fish to the
licensor.  The FSF denies that the GPL can be used to &quot;force&quot;
proprietary software to become open source by relying on this
interpretation: There is no provision in the Copyright Act to require
distribution of infringing work on altered terms.  A defendant found
to have wrongfully included GPL-licensed code in his own proprietary
work can be mulcted in damages for the distribution that has already
occurred, and prevented from distributing his product further.

Under the contractual interpretation, however, there is nothing to
stop the plaintiff from seeking an extreme remedy.  Ofcourse, the
court might only award damages in the case of a not-so-major GPL
violation.
