          <li>
            Prove that \((x)\) is a maximal ideal in \(R[x]\). i.e. \((x) \subset I \subset R[x] \implies (x) = I \vee I = R[x]\).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Let us use the reductio ad absurdum technique, and assume that \((x) \neq I \wedge I \neq R[x]\). Then, \(f(x) \in I, f(x) \notin (x), f(x) \notin R[x]\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Since \(f(x)\) is a general polynomial, we can use the remainder theorem to obtain:
          \[f(x) = g(x)q(x) + r(x)\]
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, since we&#39;re free to choose \(g\), choose \(g(x) = x\). Then \(r(x)\) must be of a lower degree, and hence a constant \(c\).
          \[f(x) = x . q(x) + c\]
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two cases to consider: either \(c = 0\) or \(c\) is a nonzero constant. In the first case, since \(f(x) = x . q(x)\), our assumption that \(f(x) \notin (x)\) breaks, and we have a contradiction. In the second, \(I\) would contain the unit ideal, and hence \(I = R[x]\), breaking the assumption that \(I \neq R[x]\). This leads to another contradiction, finishing off the proof \(\Box\)

        <ol class="olitems" type="i" start="2">
          <li>
            Prove that \(x^2 + 1\) is a maximal ideal in \(R[x]\). i.e. \((x^2 + 1) \subset I \subset R[x] \implies (x^2 + 1) = I \vee I = R[x]\).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Let us again use proof by contradiction, and assume that \((x^2 + 1) \neq I \wedge I \neq R[x]\). Then, \(f(x) \in I, f(x) \notin (x^2 + 1), f(x) \notin R[x]\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Since \(f(x)\) is a general polynomial, we can use the remainder theorem to obtain:
          \[f(x) = g(x)q(x) + r(x)\]
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, choose \(g(x) = x + \alpha\); \(r(x)\) can only be a zero, because if it were a nonzero constant, \(f(x)\) would contain \(1\), and hence \(f(x) \in R[x]\) otherwise:
          \[f(x) = (x + \alpha)q(x)\]
        </p>
        <p>
          Since \(f(x) \in I\) from our assumption, we get \(I = (x + \alpha)\). Note that \(x^2 + 1 \in I\), from our hypothesis:
          \[x^2 + 1 = (x + \alpha)h(x)\]
        </p>
        <p>
          But \(x^2 + 1\) is irreducible in \(R[x]\); assume that it factors:
          \[x^2 + 1 = (x - a)(x - b) = x^2 - (a + b) . x + ab\]
          \[\implies a + b = 0 \wedge ab = 1 \implies a^2 = -1\]
        </p>
        <p>
          This cannot happen in \(R[x]\), and we hence arrive at a contradiction \(\Box\)

            Provide an example of an irreducible element which is not prime, in a ring of your choosing.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Consider the ring of Gauss integers \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\). Then \(6 = 2 . 3 = (1 + \sqrt{-5}) (1 + \sqrt{-5})\), and this ring is not a unique factorization domain. Let us inspect \(2\): it belongs to the multiplicative set containing \(2 . 3\), but it does not divide either \(1 + \sqrt{-5}\) or \(1 - \sqrt{-5}\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Prime ideals are defined as \(A \backslash S\), where \(S\) is a multiplicative set such that:
          \[fg \in S \implies f \in S \wedge g \in S\]
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\) does not cleave into \(S\) and \(A \backslash S\) cleanly when \(6 \in S\). Since \(1 + \sqrt{-5}\) or \(1 - \sqrt{-5}\) are prime, \(2\) and \(3\) are disjoint from the set containing them, and so are in S. Hence, \(2\) is not prime, but is irreducible, as required \(\Box\)

        <p>
          Proof: The definition of a prime ideal \(P\) is:

        </p>

          From this definition, it should be clear that maximal ideals can never be the product of two different ideals \(J\) and \(K\), for if it were, then
          \[M = JK \subsetneq J \subsetneq A \text{ or } M = JK \subsetneq K \subsetneq A\]

        <p>
          contradicting the definition of a maximal ideal. i.e. for \(j \in J, k \in K\)
          \[jk \in M \implies j \in M \vee k \in M\]

          \(\mathbb{C}[x]\) is algebraically closed, because all polynomials in one variable in the ring have solutions in the ring. \(\mathbb{R}[x]\) is not algebraically closed, because the solution of, for instance, \(x^2 + 1 = 0\) does not lie in the ring \(\Box\)

            Prove that \(P\) is a prime ideal in ring \(A\) iff \(A/P\) is an integral domain.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          An integral domain is defined by \(pq = 0 \implies p = 0 \vee q = 0 \mid p, q \in A/P\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof: Given that \(A/P\) is an integral domain, show that \(P\) is prime. Consider elements \(a, b \in A\). Elements of \(A/P\) are then of the form \(a + P, b + P\). Now, use the definition of an integral domain to write:
          \[(a + P)(b + P) = 0 + P \implies a + P = 0 + P \vee b + P = 0 + P\]
          \[ab + P = 0 + P \implies a - 0 \in P \vee b - 0 \in P\]
          \[ab \in P \implies a \in P \vee b \in P\]
        </p>
        <p>
          This is exactly the definition of a prime ideal, as required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof, the other way: To show \(A/P\) is an integral domain, given that \(P\) is a prime ideal. First, consider the surjective homomorphism
          \[A \xrightarrow[]{\varphi} A/P\]
        </p>
        <p>
          From isomorphism theorem, \(\text{ker}(\varphi) = P = \{a \mid \varphi(a) = 0\}\). We know that:
          \[pq \in P \implies p \in P \vee q \in P\]
          \[\varphi(p)\varphi(q) \in (0) \implies \varphi(p) \in (0) \vee \varphi(q) \in (0)\]
        </p>
        <p>
          This gives us the required condition for integral domain \(\Box\)

          <li>
            Prove that \(M\) is a maximal ideal in ring \(A\) iff \(A/M\) is a field.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          A field is defined by \(pq = 0 \implies p = 0 \vee q = 0 \mid p, q \in A/M\) and \(\exists v^{-1}: v^{-1}v = vv^{-1} = 1 \mid v \in A/M\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof:  To show that \(M\) is maximal given that \(A/M\) is a field. For the zerodivisor proof, follow (viii) exactly. For the next part, assume \(w \in A\):
          \[(v + M)(w + M) = 1 + M\]
          \[vw - 1 \in M\]
        </p>
        <p>
          but by definition of maximal ideal, \((0) \subsetneq M \subsetneq A\), with no ideals in between either; hence, the only choice for \(vw\) is \(1\), which implies that \(w = v^{-1}\) as required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof, the other way: To show that \(A/M\) is a field, given \(M\) is maximal. Consider the surjective homomorphism:
          \[A \xrightarrow[]{\varphi} A/M\]
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, since \(A/M\) is a field, the only ideals are \((0)\) and \((1)\); by isomorphism theorem, there is a bijective correspondence between ideals of \(A\) containing \(M\) and those of \(A/M\).
          \[\varphi^{-1}(0) = ker(\varphi) = (0)\]
          \[\varphi^{-1}(1) = A \backslash (0) = M\]
        </p>
        <p>
          Since \((0) \subsetneq M \subsetneq A\), we have shown that \(M\) is maximal, as required \(\Box\)

        </ol>
        <p>
          Proof: From isomorphism theorem,
          \[(P + Q)/Q \cong P/(P \cap Q)\]
          \[PQ/(P + Q) = P \cap Q\]
        </p>
        <p>
          Since \(P + Q = \text{gcd}(P, Q)\), we see that unless the gcd is \(1\), \(PQ\) is strictly smaller than \(P \cap Q\) \(\Box\)
