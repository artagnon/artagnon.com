        <h1>The future of mainstream desktop computing</h1>
        <pre>Imagine something taking over Windows for general-purpose computing.
The closest contender right now is Chrome OS, but I think that&#39;s like
envisioning a dystopian future where regular users can&#39;t hack on what
they want.  Sure, it lets people deliver webapps, things work
seamlessly and out-of-the-box, and most importantly, the platform is
monetizable.  Our current contender for desktop Linux is Ubuntu, which
is in pathetic end-user shape in comparison.  Wouldn&#39;t it be awesome
if we could somehow bring desktop Linux closer to Chrome OS to build a
unified general-purpose computing device?  The revenue model is simple
too- people subscribe to a software repository for binaries.

Objectives:
- Preserve most of Linux userland.  Shell and shell applications are
  going nowhere.  Login and sudo, too are here to stay.
- Preserve most of the FHS.  We don&#39;t want applications to be
  installed in ~.
- Make an SSH-clone for logging into remote desktops.
- Applications should be able to run locally, and remotely.
- We want pluggable window managers, shells and the like.  Not a
  Windows clone where there&#39;s only one true WM, and one cmd.exe.
- Preserve application servers like Apache, nginix etc.
- End achievement: I should be able to `git clone` a web application,
  compile, and run it locally.
- Leverage existing infrastructure as much as possible.  Rewriting
  things takes time.

The idea:
Currently, Chromium is a big monolithic beast.  Start by decoupling
the rendering component from everything else- no, starting from WebKit
is too painful.  Start by embedding Chromium into X/ Wayland, so
native applications can directly render HTML/ CSS.  For the eventing
part (when the DOM changes, click/ keyboard events are registered),
find a way to get native code to talk to Javascript (?)- this&#39;ll make
it possible to replace `ssh -X` with something much more sane.
Windows/ tabs in Chromium should be handled by a native X/ Wayland
window manager.  Support native applications that don&#39;t render HTML/
CSS as well, for a migration path.  This should additionally open up
the possibly of hosted applications- where the application itself is
running on a remote machine, and you&#39;re interacting with it using
HTML/ CSS.
