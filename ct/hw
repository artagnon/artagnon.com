Find two different functors \(T : \textbf{Grp} \rightarrow \textbf{Grp}\) with the object function \(T(G) = G\), the identity for every group \(G\).

Solution: In other words, we need to find morphisms \(\alpha, \beta\), such that the corresponding morphisms \(T \alpha, T \beta\) are present in the image of the \(T\). The two required morphisms are, given \(x \in G\), \(\alpha(x) = x\), the identity morphism, and \(\beta(x) = 0\}\), the zero morphism.

Show how the field of quotients in an `integral domain` can be regarded as a functor.

Solution: An integral domain \(G\) is defined as having no zero-divisors other than \(0\).
