# Universal arrow

Let \(S : A \rightarrow B\) be a functor. For the objects \(a \in A, b \in B\), the universal arrow from \(b\) to \(S\) is defined as the pair \(\langle r, u \rangle\) with object \(r \in A\) and morphism \(u : b \rightarrow Sr\):

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
b \ar[r]^u \ar@{}[d]|{=} & Sr \ar@{.>}[d]|{\exists!} \\
b \ar[r]^f & Sa
}
\end{xy}
\]

Said differently, every arrow \(f\) factors uniquely through \(u\).

Example:

(i) \(\textbf{Vec}_K\) is defined as the vector space over field \(K\). The forgetful functor \(U : \textbf{Vec}_K \rightarrow \textbf{Set}\) is a function sending a vector space to its underlying elements. For any set \(X\), there exists a \(\textbf{Vec}_X\) with \(X\) as the basis. This fact is illustrated by the function \(j : X \rightarrow U(V_X)\), and there also exists \(k : X \rightarrow U(W)\) obtained by linear transformation. This makes \(j\) a universal functor.
(ii) Free category \(C\) over graph \(G\) is given by the universal functor \(k : C \rightarrow UG\). Similarly, we have universal functors for a free group or free R-module on a given set of generators.
(iii) For integral domain \(D\) and field of quotients \(Q(D)\), there exists a monomorphism \(j : D \rightarrow Q(D)\). The universal (forgetful) functor \(\langle Q(D), j \rangle\) maps \(\textbf{Fld} \rightarrow \textbf{Dom}_m\), from the category of fields to the category of domains, provided we take the arrows of \(\textbf{Dom}_m\) to be monomorphisms of integral domains.

A universal element of functor \(H : D \rightarrow \textbf{Set}\) is defined to be the pair \(\langle r, e \rangle\) consisting of \(r \in D\), \(e \in Hr\), such that \(\langle d, x \rangle\) consisting of \(Hr \in D\) and arrow \(f : r \rightarrow d\) implies that \((Hf)e = x\).
