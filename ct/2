Category Theory II

# Universal arrow

Let \(S : A \rightarrow B\) be a functor. For the objects \(a \in A, b \in B\), the universal arrow from \(b\) to \(S\) is defined as the pair \(\langle r, u \rangle\) with object \(r \in A\) and morphism \(u : b \rightarrow Sr\):

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
b \ar[r]^u \ar@{}[d]|{=} & Sr \ar@{.>}[d]|{\exists!} \\
b \ar[r]^f & Sa
}
\end{xy}
\]

Said differently, every arrow \(f\) factors uniquely through \(u\).

Example:

(i) \(\textbf{Vec}_K\) is defined as the vector space over field \(K\). The forgetful functor \(U : \textbf{Vec}_K \rightarrow \textbf{Set}\) is a function sending a vector space to its underlying elements. For any set \(X\), there exists a \(\textbf{Vec}_X\) with \(X\) as the basis. This fact is illustrated by the function \(j : X \rightarrow U(V_X)\), and there also exists \(k : X \rightarrow U(W)\) obtained by linear transformation. This makes \(j\) a universal functor.
(ii) Free category \(C\) over graph \(G\) is given by the universal functor \(k : C \rightarrow UG\). Similarly, we have universal functors for a free group or free R-module on a given set of generators.
(iii) For integral domain \(D\) and field of quotients \(Q(D)\), there exists a monomorphism \(j : D \rightarrow Q(D)\). The universal (forgetful) functor \(\langle Q(D), j \rangle\) maps \(\textbf{Fld} \rightarrow \textbf{Dom}_m\), from the category of fields to the category of domains, provided we take the arrows of \(\textbf{Dom}_m\) to be monomorphisms of integral domains.

A universal element of functor \(H : D \rightarrow \textbf{Set}\) is defined to be the pair \(\langle r, e \rangle\) consisting of \(r \in D\), \(e \in Hr\), such that \(\langle d, x \rangle\) consisting of \(Hr \in D\) and arrow \(f : r \rightarrow d\) implies that \((Hf)e = x\).

Consider the equivalence relation \(E\) on set \(S\), and the projection \(p : S \rightarrow S/E\) sending every element in the set to its E-equivalence class:

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
S \ar@{}[d]|{=}\ar[r]^p & S/E \ar[d]^g \\
S \ar[r]^f & X
}
\end{xy}
\]

This states that \(\langle S/E, p \rangle\) is a universal element under the functor \(H : \textbf{Set} \rightarrow \textbf{Set}\). As an example, consider group \(G\) and its normal subgroup \(N\); the universal element is \(\langle G/N, p \rangle\) where \(p : G \rightarrow G/N\).

Relationship between universal arrow and universal element: An element \(e\) can be considered universal arrow \(H : \textbf{*} \rightarrow Hr \in \textbf{Ens}\) from the one-point set \(*\); then \(\langle r, e \rangle\) from \(\textbf\{*\}\) to \(H\) is a universal element. If \(G : A \rightarrow B\) is a functor, then the pair \(\langle r, u : b \rightarrow Sr \rangle\) is a universal arrow if \(\langle r, u \in C(b, Sr) \rangle\) is a universal element of the functor \(H = C(b, S-)\).

Projections \(p : a \times b \rightarrow a\) and \(q : a \times b \rightarrow b\) give us another example of universal arrows. Given any other pair of arrows \(f : c \rightarrow a\), \(g : \rightarrow b\), and \(h : c \rightarrow a \times b\), we get \(ph = f\) making \(\langle p, q \rangle\) a `universal pair`. To make it a universal arrow, consider the diagonal functor \(\Delta C = C \times C\) so that the pair \(\langle f, g \rangle : \Delta c \rightarrow \langle a, b \rangle\); then \(\langle p, q \rangle\) is a universal arrow from \(\Delta\) to \(a \times b\).

# Yoneda lemma

The concept of universality can be formulated in terms of hom-sets as follows. Given functor \(S: A \rightarrow B\), the pair \(\langle r, u : b \rightarrow Sr \rangle\) for \(r \in A\) is universal if and only if the function \(g : r \rightarrow a\) and the composition \(Sg \circ u : b \rightarrow Sa\) satisfies the bijection of hom-sets \(A(r, b) \cong B(b, Sa)\). This is natural in \(A\). If \(A, B\) have small hom-sets, then the functor \(B(b, S-)\) to \(\textbf{Set}\) is isomorphic to the covariant hom-functor \(A(r, -)\). Such isomorphisms are called `representations`.

Let \(D\) be a category with small hom-sets. Then, `representation` of functor \(K : D \rightarrow \textbf{Set}\), given \(r \in D\), is the pair \(\langle r, \psi \rangle\) such that:
\[\psi : D(r, -) \cong K\]

Let \(D\) be a category with small hom-sets, \(r \in D\), and \(\textbf{*}\) denote the one-point set. If \(\langle r, u : \textbf{*} \rightarrow Kr\) is a universal arrow from \(\textbf{*}\) to \(K : D \rightarrow \textbf{Set}\), then function \(\psi\) which, for every object of \(D\), sends the arrow \(g : r \rightarrow d\) to \(K(g)(u\textbf{*}) \in Kd\) is a representation of \(K\).

A universal arrow from \(b\) to \(S : A \rightarrow B\) can be written as the natural isomorphism \(A(r, b) \cong B(b, Sa)\), or equivalently as representation of the functor \(B, S-) : A \rightarrow \textbf{Set}\), or equally well as the universal element of the same functor.

Yoneda's lemma: Given category \(D\) with small hom-sets, \(r \in D\), functor \(K : D \rightarrow \textbf{Set}\), there is a bijection:
\[\text{Nat}(D(r, -), K) \cong Kr\]

which sends each NT \(D(r, -) \overset{\bullet}{\rightarrow} K\) to \(\alpha_r 1_r\), the identity \(r \rightarrow r\). The proof is indicated as:
\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
D(r, r)\ar[r]^{\alpha_r}\ar[d]_{K(d, f)} & K(r)\ar[d]^{K(f)} & r \ar[d]^f\\
D(r, d)\ar[r]^{\alpha_d} & K(d) & d
}
\end{xy}
\]

The bijection \(y : \text{Nat}(D(r, -), K) \cong Kr\) is the natural isomorphism \(N \overset{\bullet}{\rightarrow} E : \textbf{Set}^D \times D \rightarrow \textbf{Set}\). The object function \(r \mapsto D(r, -)\) and the arrow function:
\[(f : s \rightarrow r) \mapsto D(f, -) : D(r, -) \mapsto D(s, -)\]

define a fully faithful functor \(Y : D^{op} \rightarrow \textbf{Set}^{D}\), and this is called the `Yoneda functor`.

# Coproducts and colimits

For any category \(C\), the diagonal functor \(\Delta : C \rightarrow C \times C\) is given by the object mapping \(\Delta : c \rightarrow \langle c, c \rangle\) and morphism mapping \(\Delta : f \rightarrow \langle f, f \rangle\). A universal arrow from object \(\langle a, b \rangle\) to \(\Delta\), given by \(\langle a, b \rangle \rightarrow \langle c, c \rangle\) is called the `coproduct diagram`. When such a diagram exists, object \(c\) is written as \(a \sqcup b\):

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
a\ar[r]^i\ar[dr]_f & a \sqcup b \ar@{.>}[d]|{\exists! h} & b\ar[l]_j\ar[dl]^g \\
& d &
}
\end{xy}
\]

The assignment \(\langle f, g \rangle \mapsto h\) is a bijection that is natural in \(d\):
\[C(a, d) \times C(b, d) \cong C(a \sqcup b, d)\]

Examples include the disjoint union in \(\textbf{Set}\), wedge product in \(\textbf{Top}_*\), and the tensor product in \(\textbf{CRng}\).

For `infinite coproducts`, replace \(C^2\) with \(C^X\), for any set \(X\):
\[C(\sqcup_x a_x, c) \cong \prod_x C(a_x, c)\]

If \(a_x = b\) for all x, `copower` \(\sqcup_X b\) is written as \(X \bullet b\):
\[C(X \bullet b, c) \cong C(b, c)^X\]

If \(C\) has a null object such that \(0: b \rightarrow z \rightarrow c\) is the zero arrow, `cokernel` of \(f : a \rightarrow b\) is given by \(u : b \rightarrow c\):

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
a\ar[r]^f & b \ar[r]^u\ar[dr]_h & c\ar@{.>}[d]|{\exists! h'} & uf = 0 \\
& & d & hf = 0
}
\end{xy}
\]

Given a pair of arrows \(f, g : a \rightarrow b\), `coequalizer` \(u\) can be defined as:

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
a\ar[r]_f \ar@<1ex>[r]^g & b \ar[r]^u\ar[dr]_h & c\ar@{.>}[d]|{\exists! h'} & uf = ug \\
& & d & hf = hg
}
\end{xy}
\]

Let \(\downarrow \downarrow\) represent a category \(C\) with two objects and two non-identity arrows between them. Then, functor category \(C^{\downarrow \downarrow}\) can be formed:

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
a\ar[r]_f\ar@<1ex>[r]^g\ar[d]_h & b\ar[d]^k \\
a'\ar[r]_{f'}\ar@<1ex>[r]^{g'} & b'
}
\end{xy}
\]

Having defined the diagonal functor \(\Delta : C \rightarrow C^{\downarrow \downarrow}\), and object \(c \in C\), consider:

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
a\ar[r]_f\ar@<1ex>[r]^g\ar[d]_{kf} & b\ar[d]^k \\
c\ar[r]_1\ar@<1ex>[r]^1 & c
}
\end{xy}
\]

In other words, \(k\) coequalizes \(f, g\). A coequalizer of pair \(\langle f, g \rangle\) is simply a universal arrow \(\langle f, g \rangle \rightarrow \Delta\).

As an example, coequalizer in \(\textbf{Set}\) for the set of functions \(f, g : X \rightarrow Y\) is simply the projection \(Y \rightarrow Y/E\) where \(E\) is the least equivalence relation \(E \subset Y \times Y\).

Given \(f : a \rightarrow b, g : a \rightarrow c\), `pushout` is defined as the pair \(\langle f, g \rangle\) such that:

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
\langle f, g \rangle \ar[d] & c\ar[d]^h & a\ar[d]^{hf = kg}\ar[l]_f\ar[r]^g & b\ar[d]^k \\
\Delta(s)& s & s\ar[l]_1\ar[r]^1 & s
}
\end{xy}
\]

The `coproduct over \(a\)`, also called `cocartesian square` or `fibered sum` is written as:
\[r = b \sqcup_a c = b \sqcup_{\langle f, g \rangle} c\]

The pushout of \(\langle f, g \rangle\) always exists in \(\textbf{Set}\); it is the disjoint union \(a \sqcup b\) with elements identified with \(fx\) and \(gx\), for \(x \in a\).

For \(f: a \rightarrow b \in C\), the `cokernel pair` is defined as the pair of pushout of \(f\) along with \(f\). Indeed, there is some \(r\) so that \(u, v : b \rightarrow r\) are parallel arrows:

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
a\ar[r] & b\ar[r]_u\ar@<1ex>[r]^v\ar[dr]_f\ar@<1ex>[dr]^g & r\ar@{.>}[d]|{\exists! t} \\
& & s
}
\end{xy}
\]

Let \(C\) be a category, and \(J\) be an index category. The diagonal functor
\[\Delta : C \rightarrow C^J\]

sends each object \(c\) to the constant functor \(\Delta c\) - the functor which has the same value \(c\) for each object \(i \in J\), and the value \(1_c\) at each arrow of \(J\). Given \(f : c \rightarrow c'\), \(\Delta f : \Delta c \overset{\bullet}{\rightarrow} \Delta c'\) is a NT. Arrows \(F : J \rightarrow C\) correspond to objects of \(C^J\). The universal arrow \(\langle r, u \rangle\) from \(F\) to \(\Delta\) is called a `colimit` (or `direct limit`, `inductive limit`) diagram for \(F\); it consits of an object \(r \in C\), usually written \(r = \underset{\longrightarrow}{\text{Lim }} F\), or \(r = \text{Colim } F\), along with a NT \(u : F \overset{\bullet}{\rightarrow} \Delta r\) which is universal among NTs \(\tau : F \overset{\bullet}{\rightarrow} \Delta c\). Pictorially, the following diagram commutes:

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
F_1\ar[d]^{\tau_1}\ar[r] & F_2\ar[d]^{\tau_2}\ar[r] & F_3\ar[d]^{\tau_3}\ar[r]\ar@<1ex>[r] & F_4\ar[d]^{\tau_4} & F_5\ar[d]^{\tau_5}\ar[l] \\
c\ar@{}[r]|{=} & c\ar@{}[r]|{=} & c\ar@{}[r]|{=} & c\ar@{}[r]|{=} & c
}
\end{xy}
\]

\(\tau : F \overset{\bullet}{\rightarrow} \Delta c\) is often written as \(\tau : F \overset{\bullet}{\rightarrow} c\), and is called the `cone` of \(F\) to the base \(c\):

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
F_i\ar[r]^{F_u}\ar[dr]_{\tau_i} & F_j\ar[d]^{\tau_j}\ar[r]^{F_v} & F_k\ar[dl]^{\tau_k} \\
& c &
}
\end{xy}
\]

Alternatively, colimit of \(F : J \rightarrow C\) consists of object \(\underset{\longrightarrow}{\text{Lim }} F \in C\) along with the cone \(\mu : F \overset{\bullet}{\rightarrow} \Delta (\underset{\longrightarrow}{\text{Lim }} F)\), from base \(F\) to the vertex \(\underset{\longrightarrow}{\text{Lim }} F\), which is a `universal cone` (or `limiting cone`).

As an example, consider \(J = \omega = \{0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow ...\}\), and functor \(F : \omega \rightarrow \textbf{Set}\) which maps every arrow in \(\omega\) to an inclusion map (subset in set). This functor is simply the inclusion \(F_0 \subset F_1 \subset F_2 \subset ...\). The union \(U\) of all sets, with cone given by inclusion map \(F_n \rightarrow U\), is \(\underset{\longrightarrow}{\text{Lim} } F\). For \(J\) small, any \(J \rightarrow \textbf{Set}\) has a colimit.

# Limits and products

The notion of a limit is dual to that of a colimit. Let \(C\) be a category, \(J\) be an index set, and \(\Delta : C \rightarrow C^J\) be a diagonal functor. Limit of functor \(F : J \rightarrow C\) is defined as the universal arrow \(\langle r, \nu \rangle\) from \(\Delta\) to \(F\); it consists of object \(r \in C\), \(r = \underset{\longleftarrow}{\text{Lim }} F = \text{Lim } F\), called the `limit object` (or `projective limit`, `inverse limit`) of \(F\), and the NT \(\nu : \Delta r \overset{\bullet}{\rightarrow} F\), which is universal among \(\tau : \Delta c \overset{\bullet}{\rightarrow} F\) for \(c \in C\). \(\tau : c \overset{\bullet}{\rightarrow} F\) is then called cone to base \(F\) from vertex \(c\), pictued as:

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
c\ar[d]_{\tau_i}\ar[dr]|{\hole}_{\tau_j}\ar[r]^t & \underset{\longleftarrow}{\text{Lim}} F = \text{Lim } F\ar[d]^{\nu_j}\ar[dl]_{\nu_i} \\
F_i\ar[r]_{Fu} & F_j
}
\end{xy}
\]

The properties of limits and colimits may be pictured as:

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
\underset{\longleftarrow}{\text{Lim }} F\ar[r]^\nu & F\ar@{}[d]|{=}\ar[r]^\mu & \underset{\longrightarrow}{\text{Lim }} F\ar@{.>}[d] \\
c\ar[r]^\tau\ar@{.>}[u] & F\ar[r]^\sigma & c
}
\end{xy}
\]

For a discrete category \(J = \{1, 2\}\) and category \(C\), limit of functor \(F : \{1, 2\} \rightarrow C\) consisting of pairs \(\langle a, b \rangle\), is called `product` of \(a, b\) and written as \(a \times b\). Then, we have projections \(p, q\) defined as:
\[a \xleftarrow{p} a \times b \xrightarrow{q} b\]

They form a cone with vertex \(a \times b\), and we have the bijection of sets natural in \(c\):
\[C(c, a \times b) \cong C(c, a) \times C(c, b)\]

We then define \(h = (f, g) : c \rightarrow a \times b\), and \(f, g\) are called the `components` of \(h\). In \(textbf{Cat}, \textbf{Grp}, \textbf{Top}\), this corresponds to direct product.

`Infinite products`. When \(J\) is a set (= discrete category, category with all arrows identities), \(F : J \rightarrow C\) is simply a \(J\)-indexed family of objects \(a_i \in C\), while cone with vertex \(c\) and base \(a_j\) is a \(J\)-indexed family of arrows \(f_j : c \rightarrow a_j\). We have \(f : c \rightarrow \prod_j a_j\) and the following bijection of sets natural in \(c\):
\[\prod_j C(c, a_j) \cong C(c, \prod_j a_j)\]

Products over any small set exist in \(\textbf{Set}\), \(\textbf{Grp}\), and \(\textbf{Top}\); they are simply cartesian products.

If factors in a product are all equal, \(a_j = b\) for all \(j\), then \(\prod_j a_j = \prod_j b\) is called `power`, and is written as \(\prod_j b = b^J\). The following bijection of sets is natural in \(c\):
\[C(c, b)^J \cong C(c, b^J)\]
