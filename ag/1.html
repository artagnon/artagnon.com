        <p>
          Informally speaking, the collection of all functions on all open subsets of a space is termed as a `sheaf`. There are several ways of getting hold of them:
        </p>
        <ol class="olitems" type="a" start="1">
          <li>
            In terms of open sets.
          </li>
          <li>
            In terms of stalks.
          </li>
          <li>
            In terms of a base of a topology.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="germ-of-differentiable-functions">
          Germ of differentiable functions
        </h2>
        <p>
          The ring of functions on each open set \(U \subset X\) of topological space \(X\) is written as \(\mathscr{O}(U)\). If \(W \hookrightarrow V \hookrightarrow U\), then the following diagram commutes:
        </p>
        <p class="mathjax">
          \[
          \begin{xy}
          \xymatrix{
          \mathscr{O}(U)\ar[rr]^{\text{res}_{U, V}}\ar[rd]_{\text{res}_{U, W}} & & \mathscr{O}(V)\ar[ld]^{\text{res}_{V, W}} \\
          & \mathscr{O}(W) &

        <p>
          Two additional facts:
        </p>
        <ol class="olitems" type="a" start="1">
          <li>
            Let \(U_i\) be a covering of \(U\), and \(f_1, f_2 \in \mathscr{O}(U)\). If \(f_1 = res_{U, U_i} f_2\), then \(f_1 = f_2\). Thus, we can identify functions by looking at them on a covering of open sets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Given \(f_i \in \mathscr{O}(U_i)\) all agreeing pairwise, we can glue them together to make one differentiable function on all of \(U\), \(f \in \mathscr{O}(U)\).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          `Germ` of a differentiable function \(f\) at a point \(p\) is defined as:
          \[\{f, \text{open } U \mid p \in U, f \in \mathscr{O}(U)\}\]
        </p>
        <p>
          modulo the relation \((f, U) \sim (g, V)\), if there is some open set \(W \subset U\), \(p \in V\), such that \(f|_W = g|_W\) (i.e. \(\text{res}_{U, W} f = \text{res}_{V, W} g\)). Intuitively, two functions that are the same in an open neighborhood of \(p\), but different elsewhere, have the same germ. We call this set of germs at \(p\) the `stalk` at \(p\), denoted by \(\mathscr{O}_p\). If \(f\) is defined on \(U\) and \(g\) is defined on \(V\), then \(f + g\) is defined on \(U \cap V\). If additionally, \(p \in U\) then we get the map \(\mathscr{O}(U) \rightarrow \mathscr{O}_p\). We're talking about germs as [colimits](/ct/2#coproducts-and-colimits). Moreover, \(\mathscr{O}_p\) is a local ring, since it has exactly one maximal ideal \(m_p \subset \mathscr{O}_p\), the ideal of germs vanishing at \(p\). We can interpret the value of the function, or the value of the germ, at a point, as an element of the local ring modulo the maximal ideal: this doesn't work for all sheaves, but does work for things behaving like sheaves of functions, formalized as a `locally ringed space`.

          Definition of presheaf and sheaf
        </h2>
        <p>
          We will be considering sheafs on sets, and this can be done without loss in generality. The fact that \(\mathscr{F}\) is a presheaf or sheaf on topological space \(X\) is written as:
        </p>
        <p class="mathjax">
          \[
          \begin{xy}
          \xymatrix{
          \mathscr{F}\ar@{-}[d] \\
          X
          }
          \end{xy}
          \]
        </p>
        <p>
          A `presheaf` \(\mathscr{F}\) on topological space \(X\) is the following data:
        </p>
        <ol class="olitems" type="a" start="1">
          <li>
            The set \(\mathscr{F}(U) = \Gamma(U, \mathscr{F}) = H^0(U, \mathscr{F})\). The elements of \(\mathscr{F}(U)\) are called the `sections` of \(\mathscr{F}\).
          </li>
          <li>
            For each inclusion \(U \hookrightarrow V\) of open sets, we have the restriction map \(\text{res}_{V, U}: \mathscr{F}(V) \rightarrow \mathscr{F}(U)\).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The data is required to satisfy identity and composition:
        </p>
        <ol class="olitems" type="a" start="1">
          <li>
            \(\text{res}_{U, U} = \text{id}_{\mathscr{F}(U)}\).
          </li>
          <li>
            For the inclusion \(W \hookrightarrow V \hookrightarrow U\), the following diagram commutes:
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mathjax">
          \[
          \begin{xy}
          \xymatrix{
          \mathscr{F}(U)\ar[rr]^{\text{res}_{U, V}}\ar[rd]_{\text{res}_{U, W}} & & \mathscr{F}(V)\ar[ld]^{\text{res}_{V, W}} \\
          & \mathscr{F}(W) &
          }
          \end{xy}
          \]
        </p>
        <p>
          A presheaf is the same thing as a contravariant functor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stalk of a presheaf \(\mathscr{F}\) is defined to be the set of germs of \(\mathscr{F}\) at point \(p\), denoted \(\mathscr{F}_p\):
          \[\{f, \text{open } U \mid p \in U, f \in \mathscr{F}(U)\}\]
        </p>
        <p>
          modulo the relation \((f, U) \sim (g, V)\), where \(f|_W = g|_W\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Another equivalent definition in terms of colimits is:
          \[\mathscr{F}_p = \underset{\rightarrow}{\text{lim }} \mathscr{F}(U)\]
        </p>
        <p>
          If \(p \in U, f \in \mathscr{F}(U)\), then \(\mathscr{F}_p\) is called the ring of germs of \(f\) at point \(p\).
        </p>
        <p>
          A sheaf is defined as a presheaf along with two additional axioms:
        </p>
        <ol class="olitems" type="a" start="1">
          <li>
            Identity axiom: Let \(U_i\) be a covering of \(U\), and \(f_1, f_2 \in \mathscr{F}(U)\). If \(f_1 = res_{U, U_i} f_2\), then \(f_1 = f_2\).
          </li>
          <li>
            Gluability axiom: Given \(f_i \in \mathscr{F}(U_i)\) all agreeing pairwise, we can glue them together to make one differentiable function on all of \(U\), \(f \in \mathscr{F}(U)\).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Here, the identity axiom asserts that there is atmost one way to glue, and the gluability axiom asserts that there is atleast one way to glue.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, consider \(\mathscr{F}(U \cup V) = \mathscr{F}(U) \times \mathscr{F}(V)\). Here, we use the fact that \(\mathscr{F}(\phi)\) is the final object.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two axioms for a sheaf can be interpreted as "exactnesss" of the "[equalizer](/ct/2#limits-and-products) exact sequence":
        </p>
        <p class="mathjax">
          \[
          \begin{xy}
          \xymatrix{
          \bullet \ar[r] & \mathscr{F}(U) \ar[r] & \prod \mathscr{F}(U_i)\ar@<-.5ex>[r]\ar@<.5ex>[r] & \prod \mathscr{F}(U_i \cap U_j)
          }
          \end{xy}
          \]
        </p>
        <p>
          where identity is exactness over \(\mathscr{F}(U)\), and gluability is exactness over \(\prod \mathscr{F}(U_i)\).
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, consider the restriction of sheaf \(\mathscr{F}\) on \(U\), \(\mathscr{F}|_U = \mathscr{F}|_U(V)\) for all open subsets \(V \subset U\).
        </p>
        <p>
          As another example, consider the `skyscraper sheaf`. Suppose \(X\) is a topological space, \(p \in X\), and \(S\) is a set. Let \(i_p : p \rightarrow X\) be the inclusion; then \(i_{p, *}S\) is defined by:
          \[i_{p, *}S(U) = \begin{cases} S \quad p \in U \\ \{e\} \quad p \notin U \end{cases}\]
        </p>
        <p>
          where \(\{e\}\) is any one-point set. This is called the skyscraper sheaf, because the informal picture looks like a skyscraper at point \(p\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Let \(X\) be a topological space, and \(S\) a set. Then, \(\underline{S}_{\text{pre}}(U) = S\) for all open sets \(U\), and \(\underline{S}_{\text{pre}}\) is called the `constant presheaf` associated to \(S\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Let \(\mathscr{F}(U)\) be maps to \(S\) that are locally constant; i.e. for any point \(p \in U\), there is an open neighborhood of \(p\) where the function is constant. This is called the `constant sheaf` associated to \(S\), and is denoted by \(\underline{S}\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose \(\pi : X \rightarrow Y\) is a continuous map, and \(\mathscr{F}\) is a presheaf on \(X\). Then define \(\pi_* \mathscr{F}\) by \(\pi_* \mathscr{F}(V) = \mathscr{F}(\pi^{-1}(V))\), where \(V\) is an open subset of \(Y\). Then, \(\pi_* \mathscr{F}\) is called the `pushforward` of \(\mathscr{F}\) by \(\pi\). The skyscraper sheaf can be interpreted as a pushforward of the constant sheaf \(\underline{S}\) on a one-point space \(p\), under the inclusion morphism \(i_p : \{p\} \rightarrow X\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: Suppose \(\mathscr{O}_X\) is a sheaf of rings on topological space \(X\); i.e. a sheaf on \(X\) with values in the category of rings. Then, \((X, \mathscr{O}_X)\) is called a `ringed space`, and \(\mathscr{O}_X\) is called the `structuce sheaf` of the ringed space. Sections of \(\mathscr{O}_X\) on an open subset \(U\) are called the `functions` on \(U\). The stalk of \(\mathscr{O}_X\) at point \(p\) is represented as \(\mathscr{O}_{X, p}\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as we have modules over a ring, we have \(\mathscr{O}_X\)-modules over the sheaf of rings \(\mathscr{O}_X\). The definition of `\(\mathscr{O}_X\)-module` is a sheaf of abelian groups of \(\mathscr{F}\) along with the following additional structure: for each \(U\), the sheaf \(\mathscr{F}(U) = \mathscr{O}_X(U)\), and given \(U \subset V\), the following diagram commutes:
        </p>
        <p class="mathjax">
          \[
          \begin{xy}
          \xymatrix{
          \mathscr{F}(V) \times \mathscr{O}_X(V)\ar[r]\ar[d]_{\text{res}_{V, U} \times \text{res}_{V, U}} & \mathscr{F}(V)\ar[d]^{\text{res}_{V, U}} \\
          \mathscr{F}(U) \times \mathscr{O}_X(U)\ar[r] & \mathscr{F}(U)
          }
          \end{xy}
          \]
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as an \(A\)-module generalizes the notion of an abelian group, since an abelian group is the same thing as a \(\mathbb{Z}\)-module, an \(\mathscr{O}_X\)-module generalizes the notion of a sheaf of abelian groups, as the latter is the same thing as a \(\underline{\mathbb{Z}}\)-module.

          A morphism of presheaves or shaves, \(\phi : \mathscr{F} \rightarrow \mathscr{G}\), is the data of maps \(\phi(U) : \mathscr{F}(U) \rightarrow \mathscr{G}(U)\), for all \(U\), behaving well with respect to the restriction: if \(U \hookrightarrow V\), then the following diagram commutes:
