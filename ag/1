[ag/1] Sheaves

Informally speaking, the collection of all functions on all open subsets of a space is termed as a `sheaf`. There are several ways of getting hold of them:

(a) In terms of open sets.
(b) In terms of stalks.
(c) In terms of a base of a topology.

# The sheaf of differentiable functions

The ring of functions on each open set \(U \subset X\) of topological space \(X\) is written as \(\mathscr{O}(U)\).
