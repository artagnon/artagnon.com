[ag/1] Sheaves

Informally speaking, the collection of all functions on all open subsets of a space is termed as a `sheaf`. There are several ways of getting hold of them:

(a) In terms of open sets.
(b) In terms of stalks.
(c) In terms of a base of a topology.

# Germ of differentiable functions

The ring of functions on each open set \(U \subset X\) of topological space \(X\) is written as \(\mathscr{O}(U)\). If \(W \hookrightarrow V \hookrightarrow U\), then the following diagram commutes:

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
\mathscr{O}(U)\ar[rr]^{\text{res}_{U, V}}\ar[rd]_{\text{res}_{U, W}} & & \mathscr{O}(V)\ar[ld]^{\text{res}_{V, W}} \\
& \mathscr{O}(W) &
} 
\end{xy}
\]

Two additional facts:

(a) Let \(U_i\) be a covering of \(U\), and \(f_1, f_2 \in \mathscr{O}(U)\). If \(f_1 = res_{U, U_i} f_2\), then \(f_1 = f_2\). Thus, we can identify functions by looking at them on a covering of open sets.
(b) Given \(f_i \in \mathscr{O}(U_i)\) all agreeing pairwise, we can glue them together to make one differentiable function on all of \(U\), \(f \in \mathscr{O}(U)\).

`Germ` of a differentiable function \(f\) at a point \(p\) is defined as:
\[\{f, \text{open } U \mid p \in U, f \in \mathscr{O}(U)\}\]

modulo the relation \((f, U) \sim (g, V)\), if there is some open set \(W \subset U\), \(p \in V\), such that \(f|_W = g|_W\) (i.e. \(\text{res}_{U, W} f = \text{res}_{V, W} g\)). Intuitively, two functions that are the same in an open neighborhood of \(p\), but different elsewhere, have the same germ. We call this set of germs at \(p\) the `stalk` at \(p\), denoted by \(\mathscr{O}_p\). If \(f\) is defined on \(U\) and \(g\) is defined on \(V\), then \(f + g\) is defined on \(U \cap V\). If additionally, \(p \in U\) then we get the map \(\mathscr{O}(U) \rightarrow \mathscr{O}_p\). We're talking about germs as [colimits](/ct/2#coproducts-and-colimits). Moreover, \(\mathscr{O}_p\) is a local ring, since it has exactly one maximal ideal \(m_p \subset \mathscr{O}_p\), the ideal of germs vanishing at \(p\). We can interpret the value of the function, or the value of the germ, at a point, as an element of the local ring modulo the maximal ideal: this doesn't work for all sheaves, but does work for things behaving like sheaves of functions, formalized as a `locally ringed space`.

# Definition of presheaf and sheaf

We will be considering sheafs on sets, and this can be done without loss in generality. The fact that \(\mathscr{F}\) is a presheaf or sheaf on topological space \(X\) is written as:

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
\mathscr{F}\ar@{-}[d] \\
X
}
\end{xy}
\]

A `presheaf` \(\mathscr{F}\) on topological space \(X\) is the following data:

(a) The set \(\mathscr{F}(U) = \Gamma(U, \mathscr{F}) = H^0(U, \mathscr{F}\). The elements of \(\mathscr{F}(U)\) are called the `sections` of \(\mathscr{F}\).
(b) For each inclusion \(U \hookrightarrow V\) of open sets, we have the restriction map \(\text{res}_{V, U}: \mathscr{F}(V) \rightarrow \mathscr{F}(U)\).

The data is required to satisfy identity and composition:

(a) \(\text{res}_{U, U} = \text{id}_{\mathscr{F}(U)}\).
(b) For the inclusion \(W \hookrightarrow V \hookrightarrow U\), the following diagram commutes:

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
\mathscr{F}(U)\ar[rr]^{\text{res}_{U, V}}\ar[rd]_{\text{res}_{U, W}} & & \mathscr{F}(V)\ar[ld]^{\text{res}_{V, W}} \\
& \mathscr{F}(W) &
}
\end{xy}
\]

A presheaf is the same thing as a contravariant functor.

The stalk of a presheaf \(\mathscr{F}\) is defined to be the set of germs of \(\mathscr{F}\) at point \(p\), denoted \(\mathscr{F}_p\):
\[\{f, \text{open } U \mid p \in U, f \in \mathscr{F}(U)\}\]

modulo the relation \((f, U) \sim (g, V)\), where \(f|_W = g|_W\).

Another equivalent definition in terms of colimits is:
\[\mathscr{F}_p = \underset{\rightarrow}{\text{lim}} \mathscr{F}(U)\]

If \(p \in U, f \in \mathscr{F}(U)\), then \(\mathscr{F}_p\) is called the ring of germs of \(f\) at point \(p\).

A sheaf is defined as a presheaf along with two additional axioms:

(a) Identity axiom: Let \(U_i\) be a covering of \(U\), and \(f_1, f_2 \in \mathscr{F}(U)\). If \(f_1 = res_{U, U_i} f_2\), then \(f_1 = f_2\).
(b) Gluability axiom: Given \(f_i \in \mathscr{F}(U_i)\) all agreeing pairwise, we can glue them together to make one differentiable function on all of \(U\), \(f \in \mathscr{F}(U)\).

Here, the identity axiom asserts that there is atmost one way to glue, and the gluability axiom asserts that there is atleast one way to glue.

As an example, consider \(\mathscr{F}(U \cup V) = \mathscr{F}(U) \times \mathscr{F}(V)\). Here, we use the fact that \(\mathscr{F}(\phi)\) is the final object.

The two axioms for a sheaf can be interpreted as "exactnesss" of the "[equalizer](/ct/2#limits-and-products) exact sequence":

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
\bullet \ar[r] & \mathscr{F}(U) \ar[r] & \prod \mathscr{F}(U_i)\ar@<-.5ex>[r]\ar@<.5ex>[r] & \prod \mathscr{F}(U_i \cap U_j)
}
\end{xy}
\]

where identity is exactness over \(\mathscr{F}(U)\), and gluability is exactness over \(\prod \mathscr{F}(U_i)\).
