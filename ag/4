[ag/4] Properties of schemes

We have already shown that \(\mathbb{A}_k^n\) is irreducible; this argument behaves well under gluing yielding the fact that \(\mathbb{P}_k^n\) behaves well under gluing. If there is some property \(P\) of schemes that is "open", then to check if all points of the quasicompact scheme have \(P\), it is sufficient to check just the closed points. In many good situations, the closed points are dense.

A scheme is said to be `quasiseparated` if the intersection of any two quasicompact subsets is quasicompact. We will later realize that this is a property of morhpisms, not schemes.

# Reducedness and integrality

Recall that a ring is said to be `reduced` if it has no nonzero nilpotents. A scheme is said to be reduced if \(\mathscr{O}_X(U)\) is reduced for every open set \(U\). The scheme \(\text{Spec } k[x, y]/(y^2, xy)\) is nonreduced, as we have already seen as a fuzz around the origin.

A scheme \(X\) is said to be an `integral` if it is nonempty and if \(\mathscr{O}_X(U)\) is an integral domain for every open subset \(U\) of \(X\). Be cautioned that integrality is not a stalk-local property, since \(\text{Spec } A \sqcup \text{Spec } B = \text{Spec}(A \times B)\).

Irreducible varities have the conveninet property that sections over different open subsets can be considered as subrings of the same ring. In particular, restriction maps are always considered inclusions, and gluing is easy: \(f_i\) on a cover \(U_i\) of \(U\) glue iff they are the same element of \(K(X)\).
