[ag/4] Properties of schemes

We have already shown that \(\mathbb{A}_k^n\) is irreducible; this argument behaves well under gluing yielding the fact that \(\mathbb{P}_k^n\) behaves well under gluing. If there is some property \(P\) of schemes that is "open", then to check if all points of the quasicompact scheme have \(P\), it is sufficient to check just the closed points. In many good situations, the closed points are dense.

A scheme is said to be `quasiseparated` if the intersection of any two quasicompact subsets is quasicompact. We will later realize that this is a property of morhpisms, not schemes.

# Reducedness and integrality

Recall that a ring is said to be `reduced` if it has no nonzero nilpotents. A scheme is said to be reduced if \(\mathscr{O}_X(U)\) is reduced for every open set \(U\). The scheme \(\text{Spec } k[x, y]/(y^2, xy)\) is nonreduced, as we have already seen as a fuzz around the origin.

A scheme \(X\) is said to be an `integral` if it is nonempty and if \(\mathscr{O}_X(U)\) is an integral domain for every open subset \(U\) of \(X\). Be cautioned that integrality is not a stalk-local property, since \(\text{Spec } A \sqcup \text{Spec } B = \text{Spec}(A \times B)\).

Irreducible varities have the conveninet property that sections over different open subsets can be considered as subrings of the same ring. In particular, restriction maps are always considered inclusions, and gluing is easy: \(f_i\) on a cover \(U_i\) of \(U\) glue iff they are the same element of \(K(X)\).

# Properties of schemes that can be checked affine-locally

We have defined a scheme to be a topological space with a sheaf of rings, that can be covered by affine schemes. Hence, we have all affine open sets in the cover, and The `Affine Communication Lemma` will provide us a way for communicating between them.

Affine-local properties can be checked on any affine cover; i.e. a covering by affine open sets. If a scheme is quasicompact, we only need to check a finite number of affine open sets.

Suppose \(\text{Spec } A\) and \(\text{Spec } B\) are affine local subschemes. Then, \(\text{Spec } A \cap \text{Spec } B\) is the union of open sets that are simultaneously distinguished open subschemes of \(\text{Spec } A\) and \(\text{Spec } B\). To prove this, notice that given any point \(p \in \text{Spec } A \cap \text{Spec } B\), we can produce the open neighborhood of \(\text{Spec } A \cap \text{Spec } B\) that is simultaneously distinguished in both \(\text{Spec } A\) and \(\text{Spec } B\). Let \(\text{Spec } A_f\) be the distinguished open subset in \(\text{Spec } A\) that is contained in \(\text{Spec } A \cap \text{Spec } B\) and contains \(p\). Let \(\text{Spec } B_g\) be the distinguished open subset of \(\text{Spec } B\) contained in \(\text{Spec } A_f\) and containing \(p\). Then, \(g \in \Gamma(\text{Spec } B, \mathscr{O}_X)\) restricts to an element \(g' \in \Gamma(\text{Spec } A_f, \mathscr{O}_X) = A_f\). The points of \(A_f\) where \(g\) vanishes are precisely the points of \(A_f\) where \(g'\) vanishes, so

\[\begin{align*}
\text{Spec } B_g &= \text{Spec } A_f \backslash \{[\mathfrak{p}], g' \in \mathfrak{p}\} \\ &= \text{Spec}(A_f)_{g'}
\end{align*}\]

If \(g' = g''/f^n (g'' \in A)\), then \(\text{Spec}(A_f)_{g'} = \text{Spec}(A_{fg''})\), and we are done.

`Affine Communication Lemma`: Let \(P\) be some property enjoyed by some affine open subsets of scheme \(X\), such that:

(a) If an affine open subset \(\text{Spec } A \hookrightarrow X\) has property \(P\), then for any \(f \in A\), \(\text{Spec } A_f \hookrightarrow X\) does too.
(b) If \((f_1, \ldots, f_n) = A\), and \(\text{Spec } A_f \hookrightarrow X\) has property \(P\) for all \(i\), then so does \(\text{Spec } A \hookrightarrow X\).
