          [ag/2] Schemes

        <p>
          We will understand schemes through the sheaf of functions on a space. We define schemes in terms of three pieces of data:
        </p>
        <ol class="olitems" type="a" start="1">
          <li>
            The set: the points of the scheme.
          </li>
          <li>
            The topology: the open sets of the scheme.
          </li>
          <li>
            The structure sheaf: the sheaf of algebraic functions, or a sheaf of rings, on the scheme.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In the key example of affine complex variety (roughly, things cut out in \(\mathbb{C}^n\) by polynomials), the set is the set of "traditional points" that are n-tuples of complex numbers, plus some handy additional points. For the topology, we will require that the "subset of points where the function vanishes" to be closed. For the structure sheaf, we have algebraic functions on the open space consisting of points where the denominator does not vanish.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a first example, consider differentiable manifolds. Taking \(X\) to be a differentiable manifold, we see that it has a topology, and a sheaf of differentiable functions \(\mathscr{O}_X\). This gives \(\mathscr{O}_X\) the structure of a ringed space. Evaluation at a point \(p\) gives a surjective map from the stalk to \(\mathbb{R}\):
          \[\mathscr{O}_{X, p} \twoheadrightarrow \mathbb{R}\]
        </p>
        <p>
          so the kernel, the germs of functions vanishing at \(p\), is given by the maximal ideal \(m_{X, p}\).
        </p>
        <p>
          We could define a differentiable manifold as a topological space \(X\) with a sheaf of rings. We would require that there is an open cover of \(X\) by open sets, such that on each open set, the ringed space is isomorphic to a ball around the origin in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). With this definition, the ball is the basic patch, and the manifold is obtained by gluing patches together. The basic patch gives rise to the notion of an `affine scheme`, which will be discussed shortly. Functions are determined by their values at points, but this won't be true for schemes in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          To discuss differentiable maps between manifolds \(\pi : X \rightarrow Y\), we first note that they are continuous maps; differentiable functions pull back to differentiable functions. More formally, we have \(\pi^{-1} \mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \mathscr{O}_X\). The inverse image map is left adjoint to the pushforward, so we also get a map \(\pi^{\#} : \mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \pi_* \mathscr{O}_X\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Certainly, given a differentiable map of differentiable functions, differentiable functions pull back to differentiable functions. This is a sufficient condition for continuous functions to be differentiable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Manifolds are covered by disks that are all isomorphic, but this isn't true for schemes. As an example, consider two "smooth complex varieties", the algebraic equivalent of Riemann spaces, \(X, Y\) where no nonempty open subset of \(X\) is isomorphic to a nonempty open subset of \(Y\). Informally, this is because in Zariski topology all nonempty open subsets are "huge" and have more structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as we have the example of differentiable manifolds in differential geometry, we have the example of continous functions in topology, and complex manifolds with functions holomorphic functions in complex geometry.

          Underlying set of affine schemes
        </h2>
        <p>
          We will first define \(\text{Spec } A\) to be the prime spectrum of ring \(A\), the set of all prime ideals of \(A\). Later, we will endow it with topology, and define a structure sheaf on it, yielding an `affine scheme`. The prime ideal \(\mathfrak{p}\) of \(A\), when considered as an element of \(\text{Spec } A\), will be denoted by \([\mathfrak{p}]\). Elements \(a \in A\) will be called `functions on` \(\text{Spec } A\), and their `value` at point \([\mathfrak{p}]\) will be \(a\, (\text{mod } \mathfrak{p})\).
        </p>
        <p>
          An element of the ring lying in a prime ideal \(\mathfrak{p}\) translates to a function vanishing at point \([\mathfrak{p}]\). If we add or multiply two functions, we add or multiply their values at all points; this is a direct consequence of \(A \rightarrow A/\mathfrak{p}\) being a ring homomorphism. If \(A\) is generated over a base field or base ring by elements \(x_1, \ldots, x_r\), these elements are called `coordinates`.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will interpret functions on \(\text{Spec } A\) as global sections on the structure sheaf; i.e. a function on a ringed space. The notion of "value of a function" will later be interpreted as values on a particular locally ringed space.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a first example, consider the complex affine line \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^1 := \text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x]\). Since \(\mathbb{C}[x]\) is an integral domain, \(0\) is a prime ideal. \((x - a)\) is a prime ideal too, and it is maximal, since quotient by this ideal gives a field:
        </p>
        <p class="mathjax">
          \[0 \rightarrow (x - a) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}[x] \xrightarrow{f \mapsto f(a)} \mathbb{C} \rightarrow 0\]
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no other prime ideals. In the geometric picture, there is one "traditional point" for each \(a \in \mathbb{C}\) plus one bonus point \([(0)]\). \([(x - a)]\) will readily associate to \(a \in C\), but \([(0)]\) is mysterious, for it lies somehwere on the complex line, but nowhere in particular: we will call it a "generic point".
        </p>
        <p>
          To get some intuition for this space, note that functions of \(\mathbb{C}[x]\) are just polynomials in a single variable. Its value at \(([x - a])\) is \(f(a)\); equivalently, we can evalute \(f(x) \text{ mod } (x - a)\). Its value at \([(0)]\) is simply \(f(x)\).
        </p>
        <p>
          \(g(x) = (x - 3)^3/(x - 2)\) is defined everywhere by at \(2\); as we will see later, it is an element of the structure sheaf on the open set \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^1 \backslash \{2\}\). \(g(x)\) has a triple zero at \(x = 3\), and a single pole at \(x = 2\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 2: \(\mathbb{A}_k^1 := \text{Spec } k[x]\) over algebraically closed \(k\) is the `affine line` over \(k = \bar{k}\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 3: \(\text{Spec } \mathbb{Z}\), which looks a lot like \(\mathbb{A}_\bar{k}^1\), is a unique factorization domain with prime ideals \((0), (p)\). \(27/4\) has a double zero at \((2)\) and a triple pole at \((3)\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 4: \(\text{Spec } k\) where \(k\) is a field is boring: it a single one point, and has no prime ideals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 5: \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{R}^1 := \text{Spec } \mathbb{R}[x]\) is the affine real line. It is a Eucledian domain with prime ideals \((0), (x - a)\) for \(a \in R\), and \((x^2 + ax + b)\) for irreducible quadratics \(x^2 + ax + b\). Note that \(\mathbb{R}[x]/(x - 3) \cong \mathbb{R}\), and \(\mathbb{R}[x]/(x^2 + 1) \cong \mathbb{C}\). As points, we have the usual real numbers, the generic point \(0\), and complex conjugates from the roots of the irreducible quadratic. Consider the function \(f(x) = x^3 - 1\) on this space. Its value at \([(x - 2)]\) is \(7\), and \(x^3 - 1 = -x - 1\, (\text{mod } x^2 + 1)\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 6: \(\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{F}_p}^1 := \text{Spec } \mathbb{F}_p[x]\) is the affine line over \(\mathbb{F}_p[x]\). \(\mathbb{F}_p[x]\) is a Eucledian domain with prime ideals \((0)\) and \((f(x))\), irreducible polynomials of any degree \(f(x) \in \mathbb{F}_p[x]\). Irreducible polynomials correspond to Galios conjugates \(\bar{\mathbb{F}}_p\). Note that \(\mathbb{F}_p[x]\) has points \(p\) in the corresponding \(\mathbb{F}_p\), but has infinitely many more determined by \(\text{Spec } \mathbb{F}_p[x]\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 7: The affine complex plane \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^2 := \text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x, y]\) is not a principal ideal domain. Its prime ideals are \((0), (x - a, y - b), (f(x, y))\) with \(f(x, y)\) irreducible. The points of \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^2\) are therefore traditional points \(a, b\) corresponding to \([(x - a, y - b)]\), generic point corresponding to \([(0)]\), plus bonus points: for instance, \([(y^2 - x)]\) lies everywhere on \(x = y^2\), but nowhere in partiular. The prime ideals \((x - a, y - b)\) are of dimension \(0\), \((f(x))\) for irreducible \(f(x)\) are of dimension \(1\), and \((0)\) is of dimension \(2\). Notice that maximal ideals correspond to the smallest points: in general, containment between two ideals is reversed when considering containment of the corresponding points.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 8: The complex affine \(n\)-space \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^n := \text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x_0, \ldots, x_n]\) has prime ideals \((x - a, y - b, z - c)\) when \(n = 3\) corresponding to traditional points, since the residue ring is the field \((\mathbb{C})\). These are the only maximal ideals, by `Hilbert's Nullstellansatz`; it states, in the the weak version, that in \(\mathbb{A}_k^n := k[x_0, \ldots, x_n]\) for \(k\) an algebraically closed field, the only maximal ideals are \((x_0 - a_0, \ldots, x_n - a_n)\).
        </p>
        <p>
          The strong version of the Nullstellansatz states that, for any field \(k\), every maximal ideal of \(k[x_0, \ldots, x_n]\) has as residue field, a finite extension of \(k\). In other words, any field extension of \(k\) finitely generated as a ring is also finitely generated as a module.
        </p>
        <p>
          The maximal ideals of \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^3\) are prime ideals of dimension \(0\). For dimension \(2\), take \((f(x, y, z))\) for irreducible polynomial \(f(x, y, z)\). Prime ideals of dimension \(1\) are trickier, and cannot be organized in any useful way; take \((x, y)\) as an example: \(\mathbb{C}[x, y, z]/(x, y) \cong \mathbb{C}[z]\), an integral domain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that points of \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}^1\) correspond to maximal ideals in ring \(\mathbb{Q}[x]\), called "closed points", can be interpreted as points of \(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}\) where Galios conjugates are glued together extends to \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}^n\). For example, \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}^2(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2})\) is glued to \((-\sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2})\), but not to \((\sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2})\).
        </p>
        <p>
          The two natural ways of getting new rings from old, quotients and localizations, have interpretation in terms of spectra.
