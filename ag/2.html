          [ag/2] Schemes

        <time datetime="2019-03-20">Last updated: Wednesday, 20 March 2019</time><br /><time datetime="2019-03-10">Created: Sunday, 10 March 2019</time>
        <p>
          We will understand schemes through the sheaf of functions on a space. We define schemes in terms of three pieces of data:
        </p>
        <ol class="olitems" type="a" start="1">
          <li>
            The set: the points of the scheme.
          </li>
          <li>
            The topology: the open sets of the scheme.
          </li>
          <li>
            The structure sheaf: the sheaf of algebraic functions, or a sheaf of rings, on the scheme.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In the key example of affine complex variety (roughly, things cut out in \(\mathbb{C}^n\) by polynomials), the set is the set of "traditional points" that are n-tuples of complex numbers, plus some handy additional points. For the topology, we will require that the "subset of points where the function vanishes" to be closed. For the structure sheaf, we have algebraic functions on the open space consisting of points where the denominator does not vanish.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a first example, consider differentiable manifolds. Taking \(X\) to be a differentiable manifold, we see that it has a topology, and a sheaf of differentiable functions \(\mathscr{O}_X\). This gives \(\mathscr{O}_X\) the structure of a ringed space. Evaluation at a point \(p\) gives a surjective map from the stalk to \(\mathbb{R}\):
          \[\mathscr{O}_{X, p} \twoheadrightarrow \mathbb{R}\]
        </p>
        <p>
          so the kernel, the germs of functions vanishing at \(p\), is given by the maximal ideal \(m_{X, p}\).
        </p>
        <p>
          We could define a differentiable manifold as a topological space \(X\) with a sheaf of rings. We would require that there is an open cover of \(X\) by open sets, such that on each open set, the ringed space is isomorphic to a ball around the origin in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). With this definition, the ball is the basic patch, and the manifold is obtained by gluing patches together. The basic patch gives rise to the notion of an `affine scheme`, which will be discussed shortly. Functions are determined by their values at points, but this won't be true for schemes in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          To discuss differentiable maps between manifolds \(\pi : X \rightarrow Y\), we first note that they are continuous maps; differentiable functions pull back to differentiable functions. More formally, we have \(\pi^{-1} \mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \mathscr{O}_X\). The inverse image map is left adjoint to the pushforward, so we also get a map \(\pi^{\#} : \mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \pi_* \mathscr{O}_X\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Certainly, given a differentiable map of differentiable functions, differentiable functions pull back to differentiable functions. This is a sufficient condition for continuous functions to be differentiable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Manifolds are covered by disks that are all isomorphic, but this isn't true for schemes. As an example, consider two "smooth complex varieties", the algebraic equivalent of Riemann spaces, \(X, Y\) where no nonempty open subset of \(X\) is isomorphic to a nonempty open subset of \(Y\). Informally, this is because in Zariski topology all nonempty open subsets are "huge" and have more structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as we have the example of differentiable manifolds in differential geometry, we have the example of continous functions in topology, and complex manifolds with functions holomorphic functions in complex geometry.

        <h2 id="underlying-set-of-affine-schemes">
          Underlying set of affine schemes
        </h2>
        <p>
          We will first define \(\text{Spec } A\) to be the prime spectrum of ring \(A\), the set of all prime ideals of \(A\). Later, we will endow it with topology, and define a structure sheaf on it, yielding an `affine scheme`. The prime ideal \(\mathfrak{p}\) of \(A\), when considered as an element of \(\text{Spec } A\), will be denoted by \([\mathfrak{p}]\). Elements \(a \in A\) will be called `functions on` \(\text{Spec } A\), and their `value` at point \([\mathfrak{p}]\) will be \(a\, (\text{mod } \mathfrak{p})\).
        </p>
        <p>
          An element of the ring lying in a prime ideal \(\mathfrak{p}\) translates to a function vanishing at point \([\mathfrak{p}]\). If we add or multiply two functions, we add or multiply their values at all points; this is a direct consequence of \(A \rightarrow A/\mathfrak{p}\) being a ring homomorphism. If \(A\) is generated over a base field or base ring by elements \(x_1, \ldots, x_r\), these elements are called `coordinates`.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will interpret functions on \(\text{Spec } A\) as global sections on the structure sheaf; i.e. a function on a ringed space. The notion of "value of a function" will later be interpreted as values on a particular locally ringed space.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a first example, consider the complex affine line \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^1 := \text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x]\). Since \(\mathbb{C}[x]\) is an integral domain, \(0\) is a prime ideal. \((x - a)\) is a prime ideal too, and it is maximal, since quotient by this ideal gives a field:
        </p>
        <p class="mathjax">
          \[0 \rightarrow (x - a) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}[x] \xrightarrow{f \mapsto f(a)} \mathbb{C} \rightarrow 0\]
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no other prime ideals. In the geometric picture, there is one "traditional point" for each \(a \in \mathbb{C}\) plus one bonus point \([(0)]\). \([(x - a)]\) will readily associate to \(a \in C\), but \([(0)]\) is mysterious, for it lies somehwere on the complex line, but nowhere in particular: we will call it a "generic point".
        </p>
        <p>
          To get some intuition for this space, note that functions of \(\mathbb{C}[x]\) are just polynomials in a single variable. Its value at \(([x - a])\) is \(f(a)\); equivalently, we can evalute \(f(x) \text{ mod } (x - a)\). Its value at \([(0)]\) is simply \(f(x)\).
        </p>
        <p>
          \(g(x) = (x - 3)^3/(x - 2)\) is defined everywhere by at \(2\); as we will see later, it is an element of the structure sheaf on the open set \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^1 \backslash \{2\}\). \(g(x)\) has a triple zero at \(x = 3\), and a single pole at \(x = 2\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 2: \(\mathbb{A}_k^1 := \text{Spec } k[x]\) over algebraically closed \(k\) is the `affine line` over \(k = \bar{k}\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 3: \(\text{Spec } \mathbb{Z}\), which looks a lot like \(\mathbb{A}_\bar{k}^1\), is a unique factorization domain with prime ideals \((0), (p)\). \(27/4\) has a double zero at \((2)\) and a triple pole at \((3)\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 4: \(\text{Spec } k\) where \(k\) is a field is boring: it a single one point, and has no prime ideals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 5: \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{R}^1 := \text{Spec } \mathbb{R}[x]\) is the affine real line. It is a Eucledian domain with prime ideals \((0), (x - a)\) for \(a \in R\), and \((x^2 + ax + b)\) for irreducible quadratics \(x^2 + ax + b\). Note that \(\mathbb{R}[x]/(x - 3) \cong \mathbb{R}\), and \(\mathbb{R}[x]/(x^2 + 1) \cong \mathbb{C}\). As points, we have the usual real numbers, the generic point \(0\), and complex conjugates from the roots of the irreducible quadratic. Consider the function \(f(x) = x^3 - 1\) on this space. Its value at \([(x - 2)]\) is \(7\), and \(x^3 - 1 = -x - 1\, (\text{mod } x^2 + 1)\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 6: \(\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{F}_p}^1 := \text{Spec } \mathbb{F}_p[x]\) is the affine line over \(\mathbb{F}_p[x]\). \(\mathbb{F}_p[x]\) is a Eucledian domain with prime ideals \((0)\) and \((f(x))\), irreducible polynomials of any degree \(f(x) \in \mathbb{F}_p[x]\). Irreducible polynomials correspond to Galios conjugates \(\bar{\mathbb{F}}_p\). Note that \(\mathbb{F}_p[x]\) has points \(p\) in the corresponding \(\mathbb{F}_p\), but has infinitely many more determined by \(\text{Spec } \mathbb{F}_p[x]\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 7: The affine complex plane \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^2 := \text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x, y]\) is not a principal ideal domain. Its prime ideals are \((0), (x - a, y - b), (f(x, y))\) with \(f(x, y)\) irreducible. The points of \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^2\) are therefore traditional points \(a, b\) corresponding to \([(x - a, y - b)]\), generic point corresponding to \([(0)]\), plus bonus points: for instance, \([(y^2 - x)]\) lies everywhere on \(x = y^2\), but nowhere in partiular. The prime ideals \((x - a, y - b)\) are of dimension \(0\), \((f(x))\) for irreducible \(f(x)\) are of dimension \(1\), and \((0)\) is of dimension \(2\). Notice that maximal ideals correspond to the smallest points: in general, containment between two ideals is reversed when considering containment of the corresponding points.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example 8: The complex affine \(n\)-space \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^n := \text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x_0, \ldots, x_n]\) has prime ideals \((x - a, y - b, z - c)\) when \(n = 3\) corresponding to traditional points, since the residue ring is the field \((\mathbb{C})\). These are the only maximal ideals, by `Hilbert's Nullstellansatz`; it states, in the the weak version, that in \(\mathbb{A}_k^n := k[x_0, \ldots, x_n]\) for \(k\) an algebraically closed field, the only maximal ideals are \((x_0 - a_0, \ldots, x_n - a_n)\).
        </p>
        <p>
          The strong version of the Nullstellansatz states that, for any field \(k\), every maximal ideal of \(k[x_0, \ldots, x_n]\) has as residue field, a finite extension of \(k\). In other words, any field extension of \(k\) finitely generated as a ring is also finitely generated as a module.
        </p>
        <p>
          The maximal ideals of \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^3\) are prime ideals of dimension \(0\). For dimension \(2\), take \((f(x, y, z))\) for irreducible polynomial \(f(x, y, z)\). Prime ideals of dimension \(1\) are trickier, and cannot be organized in any useful way; take \((x, y)\) as an example: \(\mathbb{C}[x, y, z]/(x, y) \cong \mathbb{C}[z]\), an integral domain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that points of \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}^1\) correspond to maximal ideals in ring \(\mathbb{Q}[x]\), called "closed points", can be interpreted as points of \(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}\) where Galios conjugates are glued together extends to \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}^n\). For example, \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}^2(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2})\) is glued to \((-\sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2})\), but not to \((\sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2})\).
        </p>
        <p>
          The two natural ways of getting new rings from old, quotients and localizations, have interpretation in terms of spectra:
        </p>
        <ol class="olitems" type="a" start="1">
          <li>
            Quotients. \(\text{Spec } A/I\) is a subset of \(\text{Spec } A\). Prime ideals of \(A/I\) are in bijective correspondence with prime ideals of \(A\) containing \(I\). Consider the picture of affine complex varieties. Suppose \(A\) is a finitely generated \(\mathbb{C}\)-algebra, generated by \(x_1, \ldots, x_n\) with the relations \(f_1(x_1, \ldots, x_n) =  \ldots = f_r(x_1, \ldots, x_n)\). This gives us an interpretation of \(\text{Spec } A\) as a subset of \(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{C}^n\), which we think of as "traditional points" along with some "bonus points" not yet fully described. To obtain the traditional points, simply solve \(f_1 = \ldots f_r = 0\). The entire picture carries over, along with the Nullstellansatz, when \(\mathbb{C}\) is replaced by any algebraically closed field.
          </li>
          <li>
            Localizations. \(\text{Spec } S^{-1}A\) is a subset of \(\text{Spec } A\). There are two important flavors of localization, namely \(\{1, f, f^2, \ldots\}^{-1} A\) for \(f \in A\) and \((A \backslash \mathfrak{p})^{-1} A\). If \(S = \{1, f, f^2, \ldots\}\), the prime ideals of \(S^{-1} A\) are just those where \(f\) does not vanish, and we will call this a `distinguished open set`. For instance, \(\mathbb{C}[x, y]_{y - x^2}\) is pictured as the affine plane with points on \(y = x^2\) thrown out; i.e. points \((a, a^2)\) for \(a \in \mathbb{C}\), by which we mean \([(x - a, y - a^2)]\), as well as a "new kind of point" \([(y - x^2)]\). \(A \rightarrow S^{-1} A\) is non-injective, and this may lead to some confusion. For instance, take \(A = \mathbb{C}[x, y]/(xy)\) with \(f = x\). We end up with an isomorphism \((\mathbb{C}[x, y]/(xy))_x \xrightarrow{~} (\mathbb{C}[x])_x\). For \(S = A \backslash \mathfrak{p}\), prime ideals of \(S^{-1} A\) are just those prime ideals of \(A\) contained in \(\mathfrak{p}\). For example, setting \(\mathfrak{p} = (x, y)\) in \(\mathbb{C}[x, y]\), we get "things" through origin; indeed, the zero-dimensional points \([(x, y)]\), the two-dimensional point \([(0)]\), and the one-dimensional points \(f\) for which \(f(0, 0) = 0\); i.e. irreducible curves through origin. As an important example, consider \(A = k[x]\) and \(\mathfrak{p} = (x)\), or any maximal ideal. Then \(A_\mathfrak{p}\) is the germ of a "smooth curve" where one point is a "classical point", and another is a "generic point of the curve". This is an example of a `discrete valuation ring`.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Therefore, maps of rings induce maps of spectra.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an algebraically closed affine variety, the translation between maps given by explicit functions and maps of rings is quite direct. For example, consider the parabola in \(\mathbb{C}^2\) given by \(b = a^2\) and the parabola in \(\mathbb{C}^3\) given by \(y = x^2, z = y^2\). Suppose that the map sends the point \((a, b) \in \mathbb{C}^2\) to the point \((a, b, b^2) \in \mathbb{C}^3\). In our new language, we have the map:
        </p>
        <p class="mathjax">
          \[\text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[a, b]/(b - a^2) \rightarrow \text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x, y, z]/(y - x^2, z - y^2)\]
        </p>
        <p>
          given by:
        </p>
        <p class="mathjax">
          \[\mathbb{C}[a, b]/(b - a^2) \leftarrow \mathbb{C}[x, y, z]/(y - x^2, z - y^2) \\
          (a, b, b^2) \leftarrow (x, y, z)\]
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, we turn our attention to functions not determined by their values at points: the failure of nilpotents. A non-zero function may vanish at all points. Any function whose power is zero necessarily lies in the intersection of all prime ideals. The [nilradical](/ac/1#nilradicals) \(\mathfrak{N}\) is the intersection of all prime ideals. To specify exactly when our intuition fails, two functions have the same value at two different points iff they differ by a nilpotent. Geometrically, a function vanishes at all points in a ring spectrum iff a power of it is \(0\). A ring with no nonzero nilpotents is termed `reduced`.
        </p>
        <h2 id="visualizing-schemes-generic-points">
          Visualizing schemes: generic points
        </h2>
        <p>
          We will understand rings as geometric objects through the \(\text{Spec}\) functor: it will require us to define the underlying topology of schemes first. In a classical topology, we have visualized "traditional points" in an algebraically closed field as points of the scheme, but "generic points" and non-reduced behavior gives us some trouble; in fields that are not algebraically closed, traditional points are glued together by Galios conjugation. This is the geometric interpretation of Hilbert's Nullstellansatz.
        </p>
        <p>
          The non-traditional points in the picture correspond to "closed" "irreducible" algebraic subsets. Each closed irreducible subset has a generic point sitting in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have also seen how points of \(\text{Spec } A/I\) should be visualized as subsets of \(\text{Spec } A\); \(\text{Spec } \mathbb{C}[x, y]/(x + y)\) should be interpreted as a line in the xy-plane. Similarly, points of \(\text{Spec } S^{-1} A\) should be interpreted as subsets of \(\text{Spec } A\); \(\text{Spec } A_f\) are the subset of points of \(\text{Spec } A\) where \(f\) does not vanished: these will be formalized as `distinguished open sets`. If \(\mathfrak{p}\) is a prime ideal, points of \(\text{Spec } A_\mathfrak{p}\) should be seen as a "shred of the space \(\text{Spec } A\) near the subset corresponding to \(\mathfrak{p}\)".
