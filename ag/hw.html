          Let \(Y\) be the plane curve \(y = x^2\) (i.e. \(Y\) is the zero-set of the polynomial \(f = y - x^2\)). Show that \(A(Y)\) is isomorphic to the polynomial ring in one variable over \(k\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof: We need to show that \(A(Y) = k[x, y]/(y - x^2)\) is isomorphic to \(k[x]\). To do this, consider \(k[x][y]\) as a polynomial in \(y\) adjointed with the solutions of \(y = x^2\). The solutions lie in \(k[x]\). Alternatively, the kernel of the isomorphism \(k[x, y]/(y - x^2) \xrightarrow{\varphi} k[x]\) is \(\text{Ker}(\varphi) = y - x^2\), by the first isomorphism theorem \(\Box\)
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Let \(Z\) be the plane curve \(xy = 1\). Show that \(A(Z)\) is not isomorphic to the polynomial ring in one variable over \(k\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof: \(A(Z) = k[x, 1/x]\) contains an invertible element not in \(k\), and is therefore not a polynomial ring over \(k\) \(\Box\)
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Let \(Y \subseteq A^3\) be the set \(Y = \{t, t^2, t^3 \mid t \in k\}\). Show that \(Y\) is an affine variety of dimension \(1\). Find the generators for the ideal \(I(Y)\). Show that \(A(Y)\) is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable over \(k\). We say that \(Y\) is given by the parametric representation \(x = t, y = t^2, z = t^3\), and this curve is called the `twisted cubic`.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solution: \(A(Y) = k[x, y, z]/\langle z - y^2, z - x^3 \rangle \cong k[x]\), since the solutions of the two polynomials lie in \(A^1\). Generators of \(I(Y)\) are therefore \(\langle z - y^2, z - x^3 \rangle\) Futher, \(Y \cong A^1\), and is hence an affine variety of dimension \(1\) \(\Box\)

          Show that the Zariski topology on \(A^2\) is not the [product topology](/gn#product-topology) of the Zariski topologies on two copies of \(A^1\).

        <p>
          Suppose \(\mathscr{F}(U)\) are maps to \(S = \underline{S}_{\text{pre}}(U)\) that are locally constant; i.e. for any \(p \in U\), there is an open neighborhood of \(p\) where the function is constant. Show that this is a sheaf.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof: In the axioms of a presheaf, let the restriction map be the identity map. The gluability axiom of a sheaf is satisfied trivially \(\Box\)
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Show that the [pushforward](/ag/1#definition-of-presheaf-and-sheaf) \(\pi_* \mathscr{F}\) is a sheaf, if \(\mathscr{F}\) is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof: Suppose \(\pi : X \rightarrow Y\) is a continuous function, and \(\mathscr{F}\) is a sheaf on \(X\). Then, \(\pi_* \mathscr{F}(V) = \mathscr{F}(\pi^{-1}(V))\), where \(V\) is an open subset of \(Y\). To show that this is a presheaf, let \(U \subset X\) be the preimage of \(V\) under \(\pi^{-1}\). Then, we have a restriction map for the inclusion map \(V \hookrightarrow U\). Further, let \(\phi_* \mathscr{F}(U) = \mathscr{F}(\phi^{-1}(U))\), where \(\phi : Z \rightarrow X\). We end up with the inclusion map \(V \hookrightarrow U \hookrightarrow W\), where \(W \subset Z\). This satisfies the commutative diagram for the restriction map, and the gluability axiom for a sheaf, since \(\mathscr{F}\) does \(\Box\)
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Pushforward induces maps of stalks. Suppose \(\pi : X \rightarrow Y\) is a continuous map and \(\mathscr{F}\) is a sheaf of sets, rings or \(A\)-modules. If \(\pi(p) = q\), describe the natural morphism of stalks \((\pi_* \mathscr{F})_q \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_p\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Solution: The task is to describe the map \(\underset{\longrightarrow}{\text{Lim }} \mathscr{F}(\pi^{-1}(V)) \rightarrow \underset{\longrightarrow}{\text{Lim }} \mathscr{F}(U)\), where \(p \in U \subset X, q \in V \subset Y\). This maps the colimit of the sheaf of the preimage of \(V\) to that of the subset \(U\); in other words, what we have is the identity map \(\Box\)
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          If \((X, \mathscr{O}_X)\) is a ringed space, and \(\mathscr{F}\) is an \(\mathscr{O}_X\)-module, describe how for each \(p \in X\), \(\mathscr{F}_p\) is an \(\mathscr{O}_{X, p}\)-module.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solution: For \(\mathscr{F}\) to be an \(\mathscr{O}_X\)-module, the following diagram must commute, for \(U \subset V\):
        </p>
        <p class="mathjax">

          \mathscr{F}(U) \times \mathscr{O}_X(U)\ar[r] & \mathscr{F}(U)

          Taking colimits for all open neighborhoods \(U, V\) such that \(U \subset V\), we get the required result \(\Box\)

          Show that the sequence of presheaves \(0 \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_1 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_n \rightarrow 0\) is exact only if \(0 \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_1(U) \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_n(U) \rightarrow 0\) is, for all \(U\).

          Suppose \(\phi : \mathscr{F} \rightarrow \mathscr{G}\) is a morphism of sheaves. Show that the presheaf kernel \(\text{ker}_\text{pre} \phi\) is in fact a sheaf. Further show that it satisfies the universal property of kernels.

          Let \(X\) be \(\mathbb{C}\) with classical topology. Let \(\underline{\mathbb{Z}}\) be the constant sheaf on \(X\) associated to \(\mathbb{Z}\), \(\mathscr{O}_X\) the sheaf of holomorphic functions, and \(\mathscr{F}\) the presheaf of functions admitting a holomorphic logarithm. Describe the exact sequence of presheaves on \(X\):

          where \(\underline{\mathbb{Z}} \rightarrow \mathscr{O}_X\) is a natural inclusion, and \(\mathscr{O}_X \rightarrow \mathscr{F}\) is given by \(f \mapsto \text{exp}(2 \pi i f)\). Show that \(\mathscr{F}\) is not a sheaf.

          Prove that a section of a sheaf of sets is determined by its germs; i.e. the natural map is injective:

          Show that \(\text{Supp}(s)\) is a closed subset of \(X\).

        <hr />
        <p>
          Prove that any choice of compatible germs for a sheaf of sets \(\mathscr{F}\) over \(U\) is the image of a section of \(\mathscr{F}\) over \(U\).

          Sheafification is a functor. Use the universal property to show that for any morphism \(\phi : \mathscr{F} \rightarrow \mathscr{G}\) of presheaves induces the natural map \(\phi^\text{sh} : \mathscr{F}^\text{sh} \rightarrow \mathscr{G}^\text{sh}\) of sheaves. Hence, show that sheafification is a functor from presheaves on \(X\) to sheaves on \(X\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof: Using the universal property of sheafification, we get:

          Show that \(\mathscr{O}_X \xrightarrow{exp} \mathscr{O}^*_X\) describes \(\mathscr{O}^*_X\) as a quotient sheaf of \(\mathscr{O}_X\). Find the open set in which this map is not surjective.

          Morphisms of sheaves correspond to morphisms of sheaves on a base. Suppose \(\{B_i\}\) is a base for topology of \(X\). A morphism \(F \rightarrow G\) of sheaves on the base is the collection of maps \(F(B_k) \rightarrow G(B_k)\) such that the following diagram commutes:

Show that these sheaves can be glued together into a sheaf \(\mathscr{F}\) on \(X\), such that \(\mathscr{F}_i \cong \mathscr{F}|_{U_i}\), and the isomorphisms over \(U_i \cap U_j\) are the obvious ones.

          Solution: To prove (a), let \(U\) be this nonempty open set, and \(\bar{U} \neq X\). Then, \(X = U' \cup \bar{U}\), leading to a contradiction since \(X\) is irreducible. To prove (b), take closure of \(Z \subset X\), leading to \(\bar{Z} \subset \bar{X}\).

        <p>
          Solution: Since \(X\) is irreducible, \(X = Y \cup Z \implies Y = X \vee Z = X\), where \(X, Y\) are proper closed subsets. Since all open subsets of irreducible spaces are dense, \(Y = \bar{Y}, Z = \bar{Z}\). Taking closure and complement, we get \(\phi = Y' \cap Z' \implies Y' \neq \phi \wedge Z' \neq \phi\); hence, for nonempty open subsets \(Y', Z'\), we get \(\phi = Y' \cap Z'\); this is exactly the condition for separability, as required by the definition of connectedness \(\Box\)
