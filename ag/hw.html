          Let $Y$ be the plane curve $y = x^2$ (i.e. $Y$ is the zero-set of the polynomial $f = y - x^2$). Show that $A(Y)$ is isomorphic to the polynomial ring in one variable over $k$.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof: We need to show that $A(Y) = k[x, y]/(y - x^2)$ is isomorphic to $k[x]$. To do this, consider $k[x][y]$ as a polynomial in $y$ adjointed with the solutions of $y = x^2$. The solutions lie in $k[x]$. Alternatively, the kernel of the isomorphism $k[x, y]/(y - x^2) \xrightarrow{\varphi} k[x]$ is $\text{Ker}(\varphi) = y - x^2$, by the first isomorphism theorem $\Box$
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Let $Z$ be the plane curve $xy = 1$. Show that $A(Z)$ is not isomorphic to the polynomial ring in one variable over $k$.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof: $A(Z) = k[x, 1/x]$ contains an invertible element not in $k$, and is therefore not a polynomial ring over $k$ $\Box$
        </p>

          Let $Y \subseteq A^3$ be the set $Y = \{t, t^2, t^3 \mid t \in k\}$. Show that $Y$ is an affine variety of dimension $1$. Find the generators for the ideal $I(Y)$. Show that $A(Y)$ is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable over $k$. We say that $Y$ is given by the parametric representation $x = t, y = t^2, z = t^3$, and this curve is called the `twisted cubic`.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solution: $A(Y) = k[x, y, z]/\langle z - y^2, z - x^3 \rangle \cong k[x]$, since the solutions of the two polynomials lie in $A^1$. Generators of $I(Y)$ are therefore $\langle z - y^2, z - x^3 \rangle$ Futher, $Y \cong A^1$, and is hence an affine variety of dimension $1$ $\Box$

          Show that the Zariski topology on $A^2$ is not the [product topology](/gn#product-topology) of the Zariski topologies on two copies of $A^1$.

          Suppose $\mathscr{F}(U)$ are maps to $S = \underline{S}_{\text{pre}}(U)$ that are locally constant; i.e. for any $p \in U$, there is an open neighborhood of $p$ where the function is constant. Show that this is a sheaf.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof: In the axioms of a presheaf, let the restriction map be the identity map. The gluability axiom of a sheaf is satisfied trivially $\Box$
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Show that the [pushforward](/ag/1#definition-of-presheaf-and-sheaf) $\pi_* \mathscr{F}$ is a sheaf, if $\mathscr{F}$ is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof: Suppose $\pi : X \rightarrow Y$ is a continuous function, and $\mathscr{F}$ is a sheaf on $X$. Then, $\pi_* \mathscr{F}(V) = \mathscr{F}(\pi^{-1}(V))$, where $V$ is an open subset of $Y$. To show that this is a presheaf, let $U \subset X$ be the preimage of $V$ under $\pi^{-1}$. Then, we have a restriction map for the inclusion map $V \hookrightarrow U$. Further, let $\phi_* \mathscr{F}(U) = \mathscr{F}(\phi^{-1}(U))$, where $\phi : Z \rightarrow X$. We end up with the inclusion map $V \hookrightarrow U \hookrightarrow W$, where $W \subset Z$. This satisfies the commutative diagram for the restriction map, and the gluability axiom for a sheaf, since $\mathscr{F}$ does $\Box$
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Pushforward induces maps of stalks. Suppose $\pi : X \rightarrow Y$ is a continuous map and $\mathscr{F}$ is a sheaf of sets, rings or $A$-modules. If $\pi(p) = q$, describe the natural morphism of stalks $(\pi_* \mathscr{F})_q \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_p$.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solution: The task is to describe the map $\underset{\longrightarrow}{\text{Lim }} \mathscr{F}(\pi^{-1}(V)) \rightarrow \underset{\longrightarrow}{\text{Lim }} \mathscr{F}(U)$, where $p \in U \subset X, q \in V \subset Y$. This maps the colimit of the sheaf of the preimage of $V$ to that of the subset $U$; in other words, what we have is the identity map $\Box$
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          If $(X, \mathscr{O}_X)$ is a ringed space, and $\mathscr{F}$ is an $\mathscr{O}_X$-module, describe how for each $p \in X$, $\mathscr{F}_p$ is an $\mathscr{O}_{X, p}$-module.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solution: For $\mathscr{F}$ to be an $\mathscr{O}_X$-module, the following diagram must commute, for $U \subset V$:

          Taking colimits for all open neighborhoods $U, V$ such that $U \subset V$, we get the required result $\Box$

          Show that the sequence of presheaves $0 \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_1 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_n \rightarrow 0$ is exact only if $0 \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_1(U) \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_n(U) \rightarrow 0$ is, for all $U$.

          Suppose $\phi : \mathscr{F} \rightarrow \mathscr{G}$ is a morphism of sheaves. Show that the presheaf kernel $\text{ker}_\text{pre} \phi$ is in fact a sheaf. Further show that it satisfies the universal property of kernels.

          Let $X$ be $\mathbb{C}$ with classical topology. Let $\underline{\mathbb{Z}}$ be the constant sheaf on $X$ associated to $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathscr{O}_X$ the sheaf of holomorphic functions, and $\mathscr{F}$ the presheaf of functions admitting a holomorphic logarithm. Describe the exact sequence of presheaves on $X$:

          Prove that a section of a sheaf of sets is determined by its germs; i.e. the natural map is injective:

          Prove that any choice of compatible germs for a sheaf of sets $\mathscr{F}$ over $U$ is the image of a section of $\mathscr{F}$ over $U$.

          Sheafification is a functor. Use the universal property to show that for any morphism $\phi : \mathscr{F} \rightarrow \mathscr{G}$ of presheaves induces the natural map $\phi^\text{sh} : \mathscr{F}^\text{sh} \rightarrow \mathscr{G}^\text{sh}$ of sheaves. Hence, show that sheafification is a functor from presheaves on $X$ to sheaves on $X$.

          Proof: Using the universal property of sheafification, we get:

          Morphisms of sheaves correspond to morphisms of sheaves on a base. Suppose $\{B_i\}$ is a base for topology of $X$. A morphism $F \rightarrow G$ of sheaves on the base is the collection of maps $F(B_k) \rightarrow G(B_k)$ such that the following diagram commutes:

          Suppose $X = \cup U_i$ is an open cover, and we have sheaves $\mathscr{F}_i$ on $U_i$ along with the isomorphisms $\phi_{ij} : \mathscr{F}_i|_{U_i \cap U_j} \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_j|_{U_i \cap U_j}$, that agree on triple overlaps; i.e. $\phi_{ik} = \phi_{jk} \circ \phi_{ij}$ on $U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k$. Show that these sheaves can be glued together into a sheaf $\mathscr{F}$ on $X$, such that $\mathscr{F}_i \cong \mathscr{F}|_{U_i}$, and the isomorphisms over $U_i \cap U_j$ are the obvious ones.

          Solution: To prove (a), let $U$ be this nonempty open set, and $\bar{U} \neq X$. Then, $X = U' \cup \bar{U}$, leading to a contradiction since $X$ is irreducible. To prove (b), take closure of $Z \subset X$, leading to $\bar{Z} \subset \bar{X}$. Since $X \subset \bar{X}$, and $X \not\subset \bar{Z}$, we get $\bar{Z} \subset X \subset \bar{X}$ $\Box$

Since all open subsets of irreducible spaces are dense, $Y = \bar{Y}, Z = \bar{Z}$. Taking closure and complement, we get $\phi = Y' \cap Z' \implies Y' \neq \phi \wedge Z' \neq \phi$; hence, for nonempty open subsets $Y', Z'$, we get $\phi = Y' \cap Z'$; this is exactly the condition for separability, as required by the definition of connectedness $\Box$

          Show that a Noetherian scheme $X$ is integral iff $X$ is nonempty, connected, and all stalks $\mathscr{O}_{X, p}$ are integral domains. Thus, under "good conditions", integrality is a union of local (stalks are integral) and global (connected) conditions.

          Suppose $\pi^\# : Y \rightarrow X$ is a morphism of rings. Define $\pi : \text{Spec } X \rightarrow \text{Spec } Y$ to be a morphism of ringed spaces as follows. The map of topological spaces is defined in the usual way. To describe a morphism of sheaves $\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } B} \rightarrow \pi_* \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A}$ on $\text{Spec } B$, it suffices to describe a morphism of sheaves on the distinguished base of $\text{Spec } B$. On $D(g) \subset \text{Spec } B$, we define:
