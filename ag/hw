# Affine and projective spaces

Let \(Y\) be the plane curve \(y = x^2\) (i.e. \(Y\) is the zero-set of the polynomial \(f = y - x^2\)). Show that \(A(Y)\) is isomorphic to the polynomial ring in one variable over \(k\).

Proof: We need to show that \(A(Y) = k[x, y]/(y - x^2)\) is isomorphic to \(k[x]\). To do this, consider \(k[x][y]\) as a polynomial in \(y\) adjointed with the solutions of \(y = x^2\). The solutions lie in \(k[x]\). Alternatively, the kernel of the isomorphism \(k[x, y]/(y - x^2) \xrightarrow{\varphi} k[x]\) is \(\text{Ker}(\varphi) = y - x^2\), by the first isomorphism theorem \(\Box\)

Let \(Z\) be the plane curve \(xy = 1\). Show that \(A(Z)\) is not isomorphic to the polynomial ring in one variable over \(k\).

Proof: \(A(Z) = k[x, 1/x]\) contains an invertible element not in \(k\), and is therefore not a polynomial ring over \(k\) \(\Box\)

--

Let \(Y \subseteq A^3\) be the set \(Y = \{t, t^2, t^3 \mid t \in k\}\). Show that \(Y\) is an affine variety of dimension \(1\). Find the generators for the ideal \(I(Y)\). Show that \(A(Y)\) is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable over \(k\). We say that \(Y\) is given by the parametric representation \(x = t, y = t^2, z = t^3\), and this curve is called the `twisted cubic`.

Solution: \(A(Y) = k[x, y, z]/\langle z - y^2, z - x^3 \rangle \cong k[x]\), since the solutions of the two polynomials lie in \(A^1\). Generators of \(I(Y)\) are therefore \(\langle z - y^2, z - x^3 \rangle\) Futher, \(Y \cong A^1\), and is hence an affine variety of dimension \(1\) \(\Box\)

--

Show that the Zariski topology on \(A^2\) is not the [product topology](/gn#product-topology) of the Zariski topologies on two copies of \(A^1\).

--

Any non-empty open subset of an irreducible topological space is [dense](/gn#countability-axioms) and [irreducible](/gn#connectedness). If \(Y\) is a subset of a topological space \(X\), which is irreducible in its induced topology, then show that the closure \(\bar{Y}\) is also irreducible.

Solution: \(\bar{Y} = X\), since \(Y\) is dense. Since \(X\) is irreducible, so is \(Y\). Let \(Y \subset C_1 \cup C_2\). Then, \(X = \bar{Y} = \bar{C_1} \cup \bar{C_2} = C_1 \cup C_2\), so \(C_1\) or \(C_2\) contains \(\bar{Y}\), and hence \(\bar{Y}\) is irreducible \(\Box\)

--

For homogenous ideal \(a \subseteq S\), show that the following conditions are equivalent:

(a) \(Z(a) = \phi\).
(b) \(\sqrt{a} =\) either \(S\) or the ideal \(S_+ = \oplus_{d \gt 0} S_d\).
(c) \(a \supseteq S_d\) for some \(d \gt 0\).

# Sheaves

Suppose \(\mathscr{F}(U)\) are maps to \(S = \underline{S}_{\text{pre}}(U)\) that are locally constant; i.e. for any \(p \in U\), there is an open neighborhood of \(p\) where the function is constant. Show that this is a sheaf.

Proof: In the axioms of a presheaf, let the restriction map be the identity map. The gluability axiom of a sheaf is satisfied trivially \(\Box\)

--

Show that the [pushforward](/ag/1#definition-of-presheaf-and-sheaf) \(\pi_* \mathscr{F}\) is a sheaf, if \(\mathscr{F}\) is.

Proof: Suppose \(\pi : X \rightarrow Y\) is a continuous function, and \(\mathscr{F}\) is a sheaf on \(X\). Then, \(\pi_* \mathscr{F}(V) = \mathscr{F}(\pi^{-1}(V))\), where \(V\) is an open subset of \(Y\). To show that this is a presheaf, let \(U \subset X\) be the preimage of \(V\) under \(\pi^{-1}\). Then, we have a restriction map for the inclusion map \(V \hookrightarrow U\). Further, let \(\phi_* \mathscr{F}(U) = \mathscr{F}(\phi^{-1}(U))\), where \(\phi : Z \rightarrow X\). We end up with the inclusion map \(V \hookrightarrow U \hookrightarrow W\), where \(W \subset Z\). This satisfies the commutative diagram for the restriction map, and the gluability axiom for a sheaf, since \(\mathscr{F}\) does \(\Box\)

--

Pushforward induces maps of stalks. Suppose \(\pi : X \rightarrow Y\) is a continuous map and \(\mathscr{F}\) is a sheaf of sets, rings or \(A\)-modules. If \(\pi(p) = q\), describe the natural morphism of stalks \((\pi_* \mathscr{F})_q \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_p\).

Solution: The task is to describe the map \(\underset{\longrightarrow}{\text{Lim }} \mathscr{F}(\pi^{-1}(V)) \rightarrow \underset{\longrightarrow}{\text{Lim }} \mathscr{F}(U)\), where \(p \in U \subset X, q \in V \subset Y\). This maps the colimit of the sheaf of the preimage of \(V\) to that of the subset \(U\); in other words, what we have is the identity map \(\Box\)

--

If \((X, \mathscr{O}_X)\) is a ringed space, and \(\mathscr{F}\) is an \(\mathscr{O}_X\)-module, describe how for each \(p \in X\), \(\mathscr{F}_p\) is an \(\mathscr{O}_{X, p}\)-module.

Solution: For \(\mathscr{F}\) to be an \(\mathscr{O}_X\)-module, the following diagram must commute, for \(U \subset V\):

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
\mathscr{F}(V) \times \mathscr{O}_X(V)\ar[r]\ar[d]_{\text{res}_{V, U} \times \text{res}_{V, U}} & \mathscr{F}(V)\ar[d]^{\text{res}_{V, U}} \\
\mathscr{F}(U) \times \mathscr{O}_X(U)\ar[r] & \mathscr{F}(U)
}
\end{xy}
\]

Taking colimits for all open neighborhoods \(U, V\) such that \(U \subset V\), we get the required result \(\Box\)

--

Show that the sequence of presheaves \(0 \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_1 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_n \rightarrow 0\) is exact only if \(0 \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_1(U) \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_n(U) \rightarrow 0\) is, for all \(U\).

--

Suppose \(\phi : \mathscr{F} \rightarrow \mathscr{G}\) is a morphism of sheaves. Show that the presheaf kernel \(\text{ker}_\text{pre} \phi\) is in fact a sheaf. Further show that it satisfies the universal property of kernels.

--

Let \(X\) be \(\mathbb{C}\) with classical topology. Let \(\underline{\mathbb{Z}}\) be the constant sheaf on \(X\) associated to \(\mathbb{Z}\), \(\mathscr{O}_X\) the sheaf of holomorphic functions, and \(\mathscr{F}\) the presheaf of functions admitting a holomorphic logarithm. Describe the exact sequence of presheaves on \(X\):

\[0 \rightarrow \underline{\mathbb{Z}} \rightarrow \mathscr{O}_X \rightarrow \mathscr{F} \rightarrow 0\]

where \(\underline{\mathbb{Z}} \rightarrow \mathscr{O}_X\) is a natural inclusion, and \(\mathscr{O}_X \rightarrow \mathscr{F}\) is given by \(f \mapsto \text{exp}(2 \pi i f)\). Show that \(\mathscr{F}\) is not a sheaf.

--

Prove that a section of a sheaf of sets is determined by its germs; i.e. the natural map is injective:
\[\mathscr{F}(U) \rightarrow \prod_{p \in U} \mathscr{F}_p\]

--

Show that \(\text{Supp}(s)\) is a closed subset of \(X\).

--

Prove that any choice of compatible germs for a sheaf of sets \(\mathscr{F}\) over \(U\) is the image of a section of \(\mathscr{F}\) over \(U\).

--

Sheafification is a functor. Use the universal property to show that for any morphism \(\phi : \mathscr{F} \rightarrow \mathscr{G}\) of presheaves induces the natural map \(\phi^\text{sh} : \mathscr{F}^\text{sh} \rightarrow \mathscr{G}^\text{sh}\) of sheaves. Hence, show that sheafification is a functor from presheaves on \(X\) to sheaves on \(X\).

Proof: Using the universal property of sheafification, we get:

\[
\begin{xy}
\xymatrix{
\mathscr{F}\ar[r]^{\text{sh}}\ar[dr]_g & \mathscr{F}^{\text{sh}}\ar[d]^f\ar@{.>}[dr]|{\exists!} & \\
& \mathscr{G}\ar[r]^{\text{sh}} & \mathscr{G}^{\text{sh}}
}
\end{xy}
\]

completing our proof \(\Box\)

--

Show that \(\mathscr{F}^\text{sh}\) forms a sheaf using tautological restriction maps.

--

Describe the natural map of presheaves \(\text{sh} : \mathscr{F} \rightarrow \mathscr{F}^\text{sh}\).

--

Show that the sheafification functor is left-adjoint to the forgetful functor from sheaves on \(X\) to the presheaves on \(X\).

--

Show that \(\mathscr{O}_X \xrightarrow{exp} \mathscr{O}^*_X\) describes \(\mathscr{O}^*_X\) as a quotient sheaf of \(\mathscr{O}_X\). Find the open set in which this map is not surjective.
