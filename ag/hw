Let \(Y\) be the plane curve \(y = x^2\) (i.e. \(Y\) is the zero-set of the polynomial \(f = y - x^2\)). Show that \(A(Y)\) is isomorphic to the polynomial ring in one variable over \(k\).

Proof:

--

Let \(Z\) be the plane curve \(xy = 1\). Show that \(A(Z)\) is isomorphic to the polynomial ring in one variable over \(k\).

Proof:

--

Any non-empty open subset of an irreducible topological space is dense and irreducible. If \(Y\) is a subset of a topolgical space \(X\), which is irreducible in its induced topology, then show that the closure \(\bar{Y}\) is also irreducible.
