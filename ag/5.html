          [ag/5] Morphisms of schemes

        <p>
          Just as we defined schemes as (i) a set (ii) with a topology (iii) with a structure shceaf of functions, let us define morphisms between schemes \(X \rightarrow Y\) as (i) a map between sets (ii) that is continuous (iii) with some additional information about sheaves of functions. We want morphisms of affine schemes \(\text{Spec } A \rightarrow \text{Spec } B\) to correspond to morphisms between rings \(B \rightarrow A\). We have already seen that ring maps \(B \rightarrow A\) induce maps of topological spaces in the opposite direction. The main new ingredient will be adding the structure sheaf of functions to this. From the geometric side, we want morphisms of schemes to be, at the very least, a morphism between ringed spaces. If \(\pi : X \rightarrow Y\) is a map of differentiable manifolds, then a differentiable function on \(Y\) pulls back to a differentiable function on \(X\). More precisely, given an open subset \(U \subset Y\), there is a natural map \(\Gamma(U, \mathscr{O}_X) \rightarrow \Gamma(\pi^{-1}(U), \mathscr{O}_X)\). This behaves well with respect to restriction, so we have a map on \(Y\): \(\mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \pi_* \mathscr{O}_X\). Similarly a morphism of schemes \(\pi : X \rightarrow Y\) should induce \(\mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \pi_* \mathscr{O}_X\). In the category of differentiable manifolds, a continuous map \(\pi : X \rightarrow Y\) is a map of differentiable manifolds precisely when differentiable functions on \(Y\) pull back to differentiable functions on \(X\), so this map of sheaves characterizes morphisms in a differentiable category. We could use this as the definition of a morphism in a differentiable category, but functions are odder than schemes, and we can't recover the pullback map from a map of topological spaces. The right patch is to hardwire this into the definition of the morphism: we have \(\pi : X \rightarrow Y\) along with the pullback map \(\pi^\# : \mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \pi_* \mathscr{O}_X\), and this leads to the definition of ringed spaces. We might be able to define morphisms between sheaves as morphisms between ringed spaces, but this isn't quite right: to each morphism \(A \rightarrow B\) there is a corresponding morphism \(\text{Spec } B \rightarrow \text{Spec } A\), but there can be additional morphisms of ringed spaces \(\text{Spec } B \rightarrow \text{Spec } A\) not arising in this way.

        <p>
          A morphism of ringed spaces \(\pi : X \rightarrow Y\) is a continuous map between topological spaces along with the pullback map \(\mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \pi_* \mathscr{O}_X\), which is the same thing as \(\pi^{-1} \mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \mathscr{O}_X\), by adjointness. There is the obvious notion of composition, so ringed spaces form a category. We also have the notions of isomorphisms and automorphisms. If \(U \subset Y\) is an open subset, then we have the natural map of ringed spaces \((U, \mathscr{O}_Y|_U) \rightarrow (Y, \mathscr{O}_Y)\). More precisely, if \(U \rightarrow Y\) is an isomorphism of \(U\) with open subset \(V \subset Y\), and we are given \((U, \mathscr{O}_U) \cong (V, \mathscr{O}_Y|_V)\), then the resulting map of ringed spaces is called an `open embedding` or `open immersion` of ringed spaces, and the morphism is written as \(U \hookrightarrow Y\).

          As an example, consider the ring map \(\mathbb{C}[y] \rightarrow \mathbb{C}[x]\) given by \(y \mapsto x^2\). We are mapping the affine line with coordinate \(x\) with the affine line with coordinate \(y\). The map is, on closed points, \(a \mapsto a^2\). So, \([(x - 3)]\) maps to \([(x - 9)]\), and the preimage of \([(x - 4)]\) is \([(x + 2)], [(x - 2)]\). The pullback of \(3/(y - 4)\) on \(D([(y - 4)]) = \mathbb{A}^1 - \{4\}\) is \(3/(x^2 - 4)\) on \(\mathbb{A}^2 - \{2, -2\}\). Before we proceed, let us point out that every morphism of ringed spaces is not a morphism of locally ringed spaces.

          Tentatively, maps of schemes \((X, \mathscr{O}_X) \rightarrow (Y, \mathscr{O}_Y)\) is a map of ringed spaces that "looks locally like" maps of affine schemes. More precisely, for the choice of open sets \(\text{Spec } A \subset X, \text{Spec } B \subset Y\), such that \(\pi(\text{Spec } A) \subset \text{Spec } B\), the induced maps of ringed spaces should look like:
        </p>
        <p class="mathjax">
          \[\mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } B}(D(g)) \rightarrow \mathscr{O}_{\text{Spec } A}(\pi^{-1} D(g))\]
        </p>
        <p>
          We would like this definition to be checkable on an affine open cover, and might hope to use the Affine Communication Lemma to develop the theory in this way. However, once we introduce locally ringed spaces, we will discard this tentative definition.
