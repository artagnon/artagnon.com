[ag/2] Schemes

We will understand schemes through the sheaf of functions on a space. We define schemes in terms of three pieces of data:

(a) The set: the points of the scheme.
(b) The topology: the open sets of the scheme.
(c) The structure sheaf: the sheaf of algebraic functions, or a sheaf of rings, on the scheme.

In the key example of affine complex variety (roughly, things cut out in \(\mathbb{C}^n\) by polynomials), the set is the set of "traditional points" that are n-tuples of complex numbers, plus some handy additional points. For the topology, we will require that the "subset of points where the function vanishes" to be closed. For the structure sheaf, we have algebraic functions on the open space consisting of points where the denominator does not vanish.

As a first example, consider differentiable manifolds. Taking \(X\) to be a differentiable manifold, we see that it has a topology, and a sheaf of differentiable functions \(\mathscr{O}_X\). This gives \(\mathscr{O}_X\) the structure of a ringed space. Evaluation at a point \(p\) gives a surjective map from the stalk to \(\mathbb{R}\):
\[\mathscr{O}_{X, p} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\]

so the kernel, the germs of functions vanishing at \(p\), is given by the maximal ideal \(m_{X, p}\).
