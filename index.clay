Ramkumar Ramachandra

Budding mathematician in Paris, interested in foundations of mechanized mathematics. Also an expert engineer, with years of professional experience working on compilers written in C++, most prominently, the Matlab compiler. I used to write a lot of [code](https://github.com/artagnon) in the past, but of late, my hacking is limited to the [software](https://github.com/artagnon/clayoven) that powers artagnon.com.

Some exercises from Tao's book can be found [here](/zfc), and a few [articles](/articles) have also emerged recently. Otherwise, unpolished mathematical notes from a year ago make up the bulk of artagnon.com.

I used to be a major contributor to [git.git](https://github.com/git/git) back in the day. If you use `git cherry-pick --continue` or `svnrdump`, you're using my code.

You can email me about anything. [artagnon@gmail.com](mailto:artagnon@gmail.com)
