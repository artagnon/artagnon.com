Ramkumar Ramachandra

I'm an Advanced Masters (M2) student at Université de Paris, in the algebraic topology track. In a year-long ongoing project with [Hugo Herbelin](http://pauillac.inria.fr/~herbelin/), we are working on formalizing semi-cubical sets in Coq. In another six-month project with [Antoine Touzé](http://math.univ-lille1.fr/~touze/index.html), we are working on learning the machinery of stable ∞-categories, and producing an M2 memoir.

Prior to this, I worked with [Cătălin Hrițcu](https://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/hritcu/) and [Kenji Maillard](https://kenji.maillard.blue) at Inria Paris for a year, writing Coq for formal verification of effectful programs.

Prior to that, I'd worked in the US software industry for three and a half years, most significantly at MathWorks for two and a half, as a compiler engineer writing middle-end compiler transforms. This was after completing my second Masters degree in Computer Engineering at Columbia University, notably producing [rhine-ml](https://github.com/artagnon/rhine-ml) as part of my compilers course.

My first Masters degree was in Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. Over the course of my summer vacations as a student there, I completed two Summer of Code projects with the Git community, the first in which led me to author [svnrdump](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.ref.svnrdump.html), and the second in which I authored [sequencer.c](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/sequencer.c). I'd been an active member of the community for almost four years, landing 200 commits.

I have been writing software since middle school, and have contributed to a [variety of open source projects](https://www.openhub.net/accounts/artagnon/positions), and my interest in mathematics stemmed from working with the [Integer Set Library](http://isl.gforge.inria.fr) at MathWorks and in my late twenties, once I was an accomplished software engineer. I have self-taught myself mathematics upto the beginner-graduate level, with some guidance from [Krishna Hanumanthu](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~krishna/) at the Chennai Mathematical Institute, in late 2018 ~ early 2019.
