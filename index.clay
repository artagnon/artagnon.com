Ramkumar Ramachandra

I'm an Advanced Masters (M2) student at Université de Paris, and I study algebraic topology. My primary research interest is derived algebraic geometry. Over the summer of this year, I worked with [Antoine Touzé](http://math.univ-lille1.fr/~touze/) to produce an exposé on stable $\infty$-categories. In another pursuit, [Hugo Herbelin](http://pauillac.inria.fr/~herbelin/) and I are working on a paper formalizing semi-cubical sets in Coq.

Prior to my Masters, I worked with [Cătălin Hrițcu](https://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/hritcu/) and [Kenji Maillard](https://kenji.maillard.blue) at Inria Paris for a year, writing Coq for [formal verification of effectful programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01237).

Before arriving in Paris, I'd worked in the US software industry for three and a half years, most significantly at MathWorks for two and a half, as a compiler engineer writing middle-end compiler optimizations. I graduated from Columbia University in New York in 2014, earning my second Masters degree, notably producing [rhine-ml](https://github.com/artagnon/rhine-ml) as part of my compilers course.

I earned my first Masters degree at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, in Physics. Over the course of my summer vacations as a student there, I completed two Summer of Code projects with the Git community, the first in which I wrote [svnrdump](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.ref.svnrdump.html) for the Subversion community, and the second in which I authored [sequencer.c](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/sequencer.c). I'd been an active member of the community for almost four years, participating in mailing-list discussions. I have been writing software since middle school, and have contributed to a [variety of open source projects](https://www.openhub.net/accounts/artagnon/positions).

My interest in mathematics stems from working with the [Integer Set Library](http://isl.gforge.inria.fr), and from reading Poincaré's [Analysis Situs](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/poincare2009.pdf), in my late twenties. The turning point was [Jacob Lurie](https://www.math.ias.edu/~lurie/)'s books, whence I decided to quit software engineering, and pursue mathematics.

I have self-taught myself mathematics upto the beginner-graduate level, with some guidance from [Krishna Hanumanthu](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~krishna/) at the Chennai Mathematical Institute, in the late 2018 ~ early 2019 period.
