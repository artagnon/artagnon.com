Ramkumar Ramachandra

Budding mathematician in Paris, interested in foundations of mechanized mathematics. Also a very good engineer, with years of professional experience in building compilers in C++. I used to write a lot of [code](https://github.com/artagnon), but I mainly study math from textbooks now: to help you locate recent stuff, I did some [exercises](/foundations) from Tao's book on analysis.
