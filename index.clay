Ramkumar Ramachandra

Ram is a compiler engineer who works on LLVM, focused on middle-end optimizations. He is currently employed at Codasip, a Czech RISC-V startup, and is based in London. He previously worked at Imagination Technologies, in their former RISC-V CPU division. His compiler engineering career started with improving the MATLAB/Simulink compiler at MathWorks, in Massachusetts. A significant portion of his work is [upstream](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commits?author=artagnon), and he enjoys being part of the LLVM community. The desire to be part of an open source community started at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, his undergraduate school, where he participated in two Summer of Code projects with Git: in the first, he authored [Subversion's svnrdump](https://github.com/apache/subversion/blob/trunk/subversion/svnrdump/svnrdump.c), which facilitates importing/exporting history from a remote SVN server, and in the second, he authored the [Git's sequencer](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/sequencer.c), which enables `git cherry-pick` to resume after conflicts. The interest in compilers was due to a [coursework project](https://github.com/artagnon/rhine-ml) at Columbia University in New York, where he did his Masters.

He took a career break between his compiler engineering in the US and that in the UK, in Paris, where he fully developed his latent interest in formalized mathematics and logic, and began a line of research with a collaborator. He continues the [line of research](https://github.com/artagnon/bonak) with [his collaborator](https://pauillac.inria.fr/~herbelin/) as a hobby on weekends.

Career-wise, Ram is always open to talk about opportunities that will let him continue being an active part of the LLVM community. A more formal resume is [also available](/resume.pdf).
