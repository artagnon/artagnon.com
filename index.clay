While finishing up my Advanced Masters (M2) studies in Algebraic Topology at Université Paris-Cité, two projects keep me busy. I'm working on a manuscript titled "Derived deformation theory and the Koszul duality" with [Ricardo Campos](https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~campos/), and on a journal paper with [Hugo Herbelin](http://pauillac.inria.fr/~herbelin/) titled "An indexed construction of semi-simplical and semi-cubical types". The Coq formalization corresponding to the latter can be found [here](https://github.com/artagnon/bonak).

Over the summer of 2021, I worked with [Antoine Touzé](http://math.univ-lille1.fr/~touze/) to produce a manuscript titled [A warm introduction to stable $\infty$-categories](/math/inf/stableinf). Prior to that project, I worked with [Cătălin Hrițcu](https://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/hritcu/) and [Kenji Maillard](https://kenji.maillard.blue) at Inria Paris for a year, writing Coq for [formal verification of effectful programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01237).

Prior to my arrival in Paris, I'd worked in the US software industry for three and a half years, most significantly at MathWorks for two and a half, as a compiler engineer writing middle-end compiler optimizations. I graduated from Columbia University in New York in 2014, earning my second Masters degree, in Computer Engineering, notably producing [rhine-ml](https://github.com/artagnon/rhine-ml) as part of my compilers course.

I earned my first Masters degree at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, in Physics. Over the course of my summer vacations as a student there, I completed two Summer of Code projects with the Git community, the first in which I wrote [svnrdump](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.ref.svnrdump.html) for the Subversion community, and the second in which I authored [sequencer.c](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/sequencer.c). I'd been an active member of the community for almost four years, participating in mailing-list discussions.

I have a long history of writing software, and continue to contribute bits to [various open source projects](https://www.openhub.net/accounts/artagnon/positions) to this day. My interest in mathematics stems from working with the [Integer Set Library](http://isl.gforge.inria.fr) while working at MathWorks on polyhedral loop optimizations, and from reading Poincaré's [Analysis Situs](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/poincare2009.pdf), in my late twenties. [Jacob Lurie](https://www.math.ias.edu/~lurie/)'s books played a significant role in my decision to study mathematics.

My mathematical background is quite non-classical, and my strengths and weaknesses are very different from people who have attended school for their undergraduate mathematical education; up to the beginner-graduate level, my mathematical education consists of bursts of chaotic self-study.
