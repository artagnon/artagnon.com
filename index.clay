Ramkumar Ramachandra

Budding mathematician in Paris, interested in foundations of mechanized mathematics. Also a very good engineer, with years of professional experience in building compilers in C++. I used to write a lot of [code](https://github.com/artagnon), but I mainly study math from textbooks now: some exercises from Tao's book can be found [here](/zfc), and a few [mathematical articles](/articles) have also emerged recently.

You can email me about anything. [artagnon@gmail.com](mailto:artagnon@gmail.com)
