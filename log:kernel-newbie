Tales from a kernel newbie

So I returned $HOME on the 7th of September 2013. Ever since, I've
been attempting to build Linux. I got the binary build done pretty
quickly, and now have to delve into the sources. The especially
problematic architecture is talking between aarch64 (ARM 64-bit) and
alpha. Since the ordering guarantees are very weak at the hardware
level, the software must reorder agressively in order to
optimize. I've also taken recent interest in user-mode Linux (ARCH=um)
and rebootless kernel upgrades. VFS has been built sufficiently with
the help of my grandad and dad, and the filesystem has been changed to
XFS.

Need to tinker with kbuild, hwmon, and ALSA drivers at this
point. Since I've taken up a job with nobody in particular, I'll
retire ARCH=alpha temporarily and work on aarch64. The base platforms
are x86: i686 and x86_64. Will stay in this gray mode for some time to
come, and contribute. Having finally made contact with Junio and Greg
k-h, I'm happy that git and linux are finally able to see one another;
I might be the first one to have built an effective arch.

Linus is a brilliant orchestrator. I'll get to spend time with my
family and contribute a lot: I look forward to life.
