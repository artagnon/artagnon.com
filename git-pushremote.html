This has been annoying me for a really long time, but I never really
got around to scratching this particular itch. I have a very common
scenario where I fork a project on GitHub. I have two configured
remotes: origin which points to &quot;git://upstream&quot; and mine which points
to &quot;ssh://mine&quot;. By default, I always want to pull master from origin
and push to mine. Unfortunately, there&#39;s only a branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote
which specifies which remote to use for both pulling and
pushing. There&#39;s also a remote.&lt;name&gt;.pushurl, but I get the feeling
that this exists for an entirely different reason: when I have a
server with a highly-available read-only mirror of the repository at
git://anongit.*, and a less-available committer-only mirror at
ssh://*.

There&#39;s a reason why remote.&lt;name&gt;.pushurl feels wrong. If one remote
has a different push from pull, there should be something
corresponding to refs/remotes/* for push (and the equivalent of fetch
for updating it). Second, I can&#39;t even diff between a branch on my
push URL and a local branch: the [ahead 1, behind 1] in status output
really doesn&#39;t make sense if the repository you&#39;re pushing to is
different from the one you&#39;re pulling from. In contrast, if you take
what I proposed, refs/remotes/{upstream, mine}/* already exist, and
it&#39;s easy to diff them with the corresponding local branch.

How about a branch.&lt;name&gt;.pushremote that specifies a special remote
for pushing, falling back to branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote?
