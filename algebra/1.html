          <p>
            An ideal $I$ of $A$ is defined to be a additive subgroup of $A$ that is closed under multiplication with elements of $A$; that is, $Ia \in I \, \forall a \in A$. The `quotient ring` $A/I$ inherits a uniquely defined multiplication from $A$, making it into a subring, the quotient ring or the `residue-class ring`. $\varphi : A \rightarrow A/I$ is a `ring homomorphism`, and it maps every $x \in A$ to the `coset` $x + I$.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a one-to-one order-preserving correspondence between ideals $J$ of $A$ which contain $I$, and ideals $\bar{J}$ of $A/I$, given by $J = \varphi^{-1}(\bar{J})$. Notice that the kernel of the homomorphism $f : A \rightarrow B$ is $I$, image $f(A)$ is a subring $C \subseteq B$, and $f$ induces the homomorphism $A/I \cong C$.
          </p>
          <p>
            A `zero-divisor` of an element $x \in A$ is, if it exists, an element $y \neq 0 \implies xy = 0$. A ring with no zero-divisors is called an `integral domain`. A `unit` of an element $x \in A$ is an element $y : xy = 1$; then $y = x^{-1}$. The units in $A$ form a multiplicative abelian group, and a ring in which every element has an inverse is called a `field`; obviously every field is an integral domain. The multiples $Ix, x \in A$ form the `principal ideal`, and is denoted by $(I)$.
          </p>
          <p>
            $P$ is a `prime ideal` of $A$ if $P \neq (1)$ and $xy \in P \implies x \in P \vee y \in P$ for $x, y \in A$. $M$ is a `maximal ideal` of $A$ if $M \neq (1)$, and there exists no ideal $I$ strictly between $M$ and $A$, that is no $I : M \subset I \subset A$. In $A[x]$, prime ideals consist of $(0)$, maximals, and irreducibles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three elementary results (proved in [ra/hw](/ra/hw)):
          </p>
          <ol class="olitems" type="i" start="1">
            <li>
              $M$ is maximal $\iff A/M$ is a field.
            </li>
            <li>
              $P$ is prime $\iff A/P$ is an integral domain.
            </li>
            <li>
              Every maximal ideal is a prime ideal.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If $f : A \rightarrow B$ is a ring homomorphism, and $Q$ is a prime ideal of $B$, then $f^{-1}(Q)$ is a prime ideal of $A$, for $A/f^{-1}(Q)$ is isomorphic to a subring of $B/Q$, and hence has no zero-divisors. But if $N$ is a maximal ideal in $B$, $A/f^{-1}(N)$ need not be a maximal ideal in $A$; all we can say is that it is prime.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every ring $A \neq 0$ has a maximal ideal, and this can be proved using `Zorn's lemma`. If $A \neq (1)$ is an ideal of $A$, then there is some maximal ideal containing $A$. It follows that every non-unit of $A$ is contained in some maximal ideal. A ring $A$ with exactly one maximal ideal $M$ is called a `local ring`, and the field $A/M$ is called the `residue field`.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let $A$ be a ring, then:
          </p>
          <ol class="olitems" type="i" start="1">
            <li>
              Let $M$ be an ideal such that every $x \in A - M$ is a unit in $A$. Then, $A$ is a local ring, and $M$ is a maximal ideal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let $M$ be a maximal ideal such that every $1 + M \in A$ is a unit in $A$. Then, $A$ is a local ring.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            To prove (i), notice that every ideal $\neq (1)$ consists of non-units and is hence contained within $M$.
          </p>
          <p>
            To prove (ii), let $x \in A - M$. Since $M$ is maximal, the ideal generated by $x$ and $M$ is $(1)$, hence there exists $m \in M, y \in A$ such that $xy + m = 1$ or $xy = 1 - m$; this is contained in $1 + M$ and is hence unit.
          </p>

            What follows is a bunch of examples:

          <ol class="olitems" type="i" start="1">
            <li>
              Let $A = k[x_0, \ldots, x_n]$, the ring of polynomials. If $f$ is an irreducible polynomial, then, by unique factorization, $(f)$ is a prime ideal. Similarly, if $A$ is a ring of polynomials with constant term zero, then every ideal in $A$ is a maximal ideal; it is the kernel of the homomorphism $f : A \rightarrow k$, which maps every $f \in A$ to $f(0)$.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let $A = \mathbb{Z}$ with ideals of the form $(m)$. Then $(m)$ is a prime ideal $\iff$ $m$ is prime number or $0$. All prime ideals $(p)$ are maximal: $A/(p)$ is a field.
            </li>
            <li>
              A `principal ideal domain` is an integral domain where all ideals are principal. In such a ring, every nonzero prime ideal is a maximal ideal.

          <p>
            The set of all nilpotent elements $\mathfrak{N}$ of $A$ is an ideal, and $A/\mathfrak{N}$ does not have any nilpotent elements. To prove this, let $x, y \in \mathfrak{N}$ be nilpotent elements of order $m, n$. By the binomial theorem, $(x + y)^{m + n - 1}$ has terms of the form $x^r y^s$; but we cannot have both $r &lt; m$ and $s &lt; n$, so each of these terms vanish, and $(x + y)^{m + n - 1} = 0, x + y \in \mathfrak{N}$. Let $\bar{x^n} \in A/\mathfrak{N}$ be a representation of $x^n$. Then $(x^n)^p = 0$, and $x \in \mathfrak{N} \implies \bar{x} = 0$. Ideal $\mathfrak{N}$ is called the `nilradical` of $A$.
          </p>
          <p>
            The nilradical $\mathfrak{N}$ of $A$ is the intersection of all prime ideals of $A$. To prove this, let $\mathfrak{N}'$ be the intersection of prime ideals. If $f \in A$ is nilpotent, and $P$ is a prime ideal, $f^n = 0 \in P$ for some $n$, and hence $f \in P$ (because $P$ is prime) and $f \in \mathfrak{N}'$. Conversely, suppose that $f$ is not nilpotent. Let $\Sigma$ be the set of ideals $I$ such that $n \gt 0 \implies f^n \notin I$. $\Sigma$ is not zero, and by Zorn's lemma, there is some maximal element in $\Sigma$. Let $P$ be this maximal element: it remains to be shown that $P$ is a prime ideal. Let $x, y \notin P$, so $P + (x), P + (y)$ contain $P$, and therefore do not belong to $\Sigma$. If:
            $$f^m = P + (x) \quad f^n = P + (y)$$
          </p>
          <p>
            then, $f^{m + n} \in P + (xy)$, hence the ideal $P + (xy) \notin \Sigma$, and $xy \notin P$. Hence, we have a prime ideal $P$, and $f \notin P, f \notin \mathfrak{N}'$.
          </p>
          <p>
            The `Jacobson radical` $\mathfrak{R}$ of $A$ is defined to be the intersection of all maximal ideals of $A$.
          </p>
          <p>
            $x \in \mathfrak{R} \iff 1 - xy$ is a unit in $A$ for all $y \in A$. To prove this, let is first assume that $1 - xy$ is not a unit. But $1 - xy$ belongs to some maximal ideal $M$; and $x \in \mathfrak{R} \subseteq M$, so $xy \in M$, and hence $1 \in M$, which is absurd. To prove the converse, let $x \notin M$, for some maximal ideal $M$. Then, $M$ and $x$ generate $(1)$, and $u + xy \in M$, for some $u \in M, y \in A$. Hence, $1 - xy \in M$ is not unit.

            The sum of two ideals $I, J$, denoted $I + J$, is the smallest set, $x + y, x \in I, y \in J$, containing both ideals. The product, denoted $IJ$ is the ideal generated by $xy$. In $\mathbb{Z}$, let $I = (m), J = (n)$; then the sum $I + J$ is the l.c.m of $m, n$, and $IJ$ is the h.c.f of $m, n$. In this case, $IJ = I \cap J \iff m, n$ are coprime; more generally, $(I + J)(I \cap J) = IJ$.
          </p>
          <p>
            In $A = k[x_0, \ldots, x_n]$, we have the distributive law $I (J + K) = IJ + IK$ as in the case of $\mathbb{Z}$. However, unlike the $\mathbb{Z}$ case,

            Certainly, this is true for $n = 1$. It holds for $n \gt 1$, if it holds for $n - 1$. Let $x_i \in I$ such that $x_i \notin P_j, i \neq j$. If $x_i \notin P_i$, we are done. Otherwise, $x_i \in P_i$ for all $i$. Consider an element $y \in I_q$ such that $y \notin P_q$. Hence, we have  $I \not\subseteq P_q$.

Hence, $I_q \subseteq P$. Finally, if $P = \bigcap_q I_q$, then $P \subseteq I_q$, and hence $P = I_q$, for some $q$.

            If $I$ is any ideal of $A$, then the `radical` of $I$ is defined as:

            The radical of ideal $I$ is the intersection of prime ideals containing $I$. In general, we can define a radical over a set $E \subseteq A$, but this is not an ideal in general, and $\bigcap \sqrt{E_\alpha} = \sqrt{\bigcap E_\alpha}$.

            Let $f : A \rightarrow B$ be a ring homomorphism. Then for ideal $I$, $f(I)$ is not necessarily an ideal in $B$. We define `extension` $I^e$ to be the set $Bf(I)$, generated by $B$. Alternatively, if $J$ is an ideal of $B$, then $f^{-1}(J)$ is necessarily an ideal in $A$, and this is termed `contraction` $J^c$. We can hence factorize $f$ as follows:
            $$A \xrightarrow{p} f(A) \xrightarrow{q} B$$
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, $p$ is surjective and $q$ is injective. For $p$, the situation is very simple: there is a one-to-one correspondence between ideals of $f(A)$ and ideals of $A$ that contain $\text{ker }(f)$, and prime ideals correspond to prime ideals. For $q$, however, the situation is complicated.

            As an example, consider $f : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}[i]$. Primes in $\mathbb{Z}$ may not stay prime in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$. In fact, $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a principal ideal domain, and the situation is as follows:

              If $p \equiv 1 \text{ mod } 4$, then $(p)^e$ is the product of two distinct prime ideals. Example: $(5)^e = (2 + i)(2 - i)$.

              If $C$ is the set of contracted ideals in $A$, and $E$ is the set of extended ideals in $B$, then $C = \{I \mid I^{ec} = I\}, E = \{J \mid J^{ce} = J\}$, and $I \mapsto I^e$ is a bijective map that maps $C$ onto $E$ with inverse $J \mapsto J^c$.

            Let us prove (iii), since (i) and (ii) are trivial. If $I \in C$, then $I = J^c = J^{cec} = I^{ec}$. Conversely, if $I = I^{ec}$, then $I$ is the contraction of $I^e$. A similar argument holds for $E$.

          <p>
            Modules let us do linear algebra on general rings, even non-commutative ones. For instances of non-commutative rings, there's no need to look further than matrices over $\mathbb{R}$, the field of real numbers. Another instance of non-commutative algebra can be found in Quaternions, that have different properties when cycling clockwise and counter-clockwise. The ideal $I$ and quotient ring $A/I$ are both examples of modules.

            Let $M, N$ be $A$-modules, and $f : M \rightarrow N$ be an $A$-module homomorphism, or $A$-linear. Then, $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$, and $f(ax) = a . f(x)$, for all $a \in A; x, y \in M$. If $A$ is a field, then an $A$-module homomorphism is the same thing as linear transformation over vector spaces.

            The composition of any two $A$-module homomorphisms is again an $A$-module homomorphism. The set of all $A$-module homomorphisms from $M$ to $N$ can be turned into an $A$-module with the axioms:

            Submodule $M'$ of $M$ is a subgroup of $M$ closed under multiplication by elements of $A$. The abelian group $M/M'$ inherits the $A$-module structure from $M$, given by $a(x + M') = ax + M'$. The $A$-module $M/M'$ is termed `quotient` of $M$ by $M'$. There is a natural homomorphism between $M$ and $M/M'$, and this is an $A$-module homomorphism. There is a one-to-one order-preserving bijection from submodules of $M$ containing $M'$ and submodules of $M''$, as in the case of ideals.

          <p>
            If $f : M \rightarrow N$ is an $A$-module homomorphism, then its kernel and image are also submodules defined by:

            We cannot define a product of submodules. However, we can define the product $IM$, where $I$ is an ideal. If $N, P$ are two $A$-modules, we can define $N : P$ as the set of all $a \in A$ such that $aP \subseteq N$; it is an ideal. In particular $(0 : M)$ is termed `annihilator`, and written as $\text{Ann}(M)$. An $A$-module is `faithful` if $\text{Ann}(M) = 0$; if $\text{Ann}(M) = I$, then the $A$-module is faithful as an $(A/I)$-module.

            If $M, N$ are modules, then their `direct sum` $M \oplus N$ is defined as the pairs $(x, y)$ for $x \in M, y \in N$. Sum and scalar multiplication are defined in the usual way:

            More generally, we can define the direct sum as $\bigoplus_{q \in Q} M_q$ to have elements in the family $(x_q)_{q \in Q}$. For a finite index set $Q$, direct sum and `direct product`, $\prod_{q \in Q} M_q$, are the same thing, but not otherwise.

This is not a subring in general, because it does not contain identity. By considering ring $A$ as a module, we have its decomposition into the direct sum of ideals. Conversely, given a ideal decomposition of a ring:

            $M$ is a finitely generated $A$ module $\iff M$ is isomorphic to the quotient of $A^n$ for some $n \gt 0$. To prove this, let $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ generate $M$, and $\varphi : A^n \rightarrow M$ be defined by $\varphi(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = a_1 x_1 + \ldots + a_n x_n$. Then, $\varphi$ is an $A$-module homomorphism onto $M$ and $M \cong A^n/\text{Ker}(\varphi)$. Conversely, if $e_i = (0, \ldots, 1, \ldots, 0)$, with $1$ being in the $i^{\text{th}}$ place, then $e_i$s generate $A^n$, and hence $\varphi(e_i)$ generate $M$.

            Nakayama's lemma, corollary: Let $M$ be a finitely generated $A$-module, and $I$ be an ideal in $A$. If $M = IM$, then $\exists x \in A \text{ such that } x \equiv 1 \text{ mod } I$ and $xM = 0$.

To prove this, notice that we have $xM = 0$ for some $x \equiv 1 \text{ mod } \mathfrak{R}$, by the corollary. But $x$ is a unit in $A$, and hence $M = x^{-1}xM = 0$.

Then, $N/MN$ is annihilated by $M$, hence is an $A/M$-module i.e. a $k$-vector space that is finite-dimensional. Let $x_i$s be the elements of $N$ whose image is in $N/MN$. Then, $x_i$s generate $N$. To prove this, let $S$ be the submodule of $N$ generated by $x_i$, so it remains to be shown that $S = N$.

            The boundary homomorphism $d$ is defined as follows: if $x'' = \text{Ker}(f'')$, then $x'' = v(x)$ for some $x \in M$, and $v'(f(x)) = f'(v(x))$, hence $f(x) \in \text{Ker}(v') = \text{Im}(u')$ so that $f(x) = u'(y')$ for some $y' in N'$.

            Let $C$ be a class of $A$-modules, and $\lambda$ a function with values in abelian group $G$. $\lambda$ is `additive` if, for each s.e.s with terms in $C$, we have $\lambda(L) - \lambda(M) + \lambda(N) = 0$. As an example, let $A$ be a vector space $k$, and $C$ be the class of all vector spaces $V$. Then $V \mapsto \text{dim}(V)$ is additive.

            Let $M, N, P$ be three $A$-modules. The mapping $f : M \times N \rightarrow P$ is said to be $A$-bilinear if, for each $x \in M, y \in N$, the mapping $y \rightarrow (x, y)$ of $N$ onto $P$, and the mapping $x \rightarrow (x, y)$ of $M$ onto $P$, are both $A$-linear.

            We construct an $A$-module $T$, called the `tensor product`, if the $A$-bilinear mapping $M \times N \rightarrow P$ is in one-to-one correspondence with $A$-linear mappings $T \rightarrow P$, for all $A$-modules $P$. More precisely, there exists a pair $(T, g)$ consisting of $A$-module $T$ and $A$-bilinear mapping $g : M \times N \rightarrow T$, such that $f = f' \circ g$, where $f' : T \rightarrow P$ is a unique $A$-linear mapping. In other words, every mapping $M \times N$ factors uniquely through $T$.

            Note that tensor product notation $x \otimes y$ is ambiguous; it may be zero in $M' \times N'$, submodules of $M, N$, while being zero in modules $M, N$. For example, consider $M = \mathbb{Z}, N = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}, M' =$ submodule $2 \mathbb{Z}$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ while $N' = N$. Then, $2 \otimes x = 1 \otimes 2x = 1 \otimes 0 = 0$, but is nonzero as an element of $M' \otimes N'$.

            Let $x_i \in M, y_i \in N$, and $\sum x_i \otimes y_i = 0$ in $M \times N$. Then, there exist finitely generated submodules $M_0, N_0$ of $M, N$ such that $\sum x_i \otimes y_i = 0$ in $M_0 \otimes N_0$. To prove this, consider $\sum (x_i, y_i) = D$; then $\sum (x_i, y_i)$ is a finite sum of generators of $D$. Let $M_0$ be the submodule of $M$ generated by the $x_i$ and all the elements of $M$ that occur as the first coordinates in these generators of $D$. Define $N_0$ similarly. Then, $\sum x_i \otimes y_i = 0$ in $M_0 \otimes N_0$, as required.

To prove this, let $y_1, \ldots, y_n$ generate $N$ over $B$, $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ generate $B$ as an $A$-module. Then the $mn$ products $x_i y_j$ generate $M$ over $A$.

            Let $f : M \otimes N \rightarrow P$ be an $A$-bilinear mapping. Then, the mapping $N \rightarrow P$ given by $y \mapsto (x, y)$ is $A$-linear, and hence $f$ gives rise to the mapping $M \rightarrow \text{Hom}(N, P)$, which is also $A$-linear, because $f$ is linear in the variable $x$. Conversely, the $A$-homomorphism $\varphi : M \rightarrow \text{Hom}_A(N, P)$ is a bilinear map given by $(x, y) \rightarrow \varphi(x) \varphi(y)$. Hence the set $S$ of bilinear mappings $M \times N \rightarrow P$ is in natural one-to-one correspondence with $\text{Hom}(M, \text{Hom}(N, P))$. On the other hand, $S$ is in one-to-one correspondence with $\text{Hom}(M \otimes N, P)$, by definition of tensor product. Hence:

            To prove this, let $E$ denote the first sequence, $E \otimes N$ the second sequence, and $P$ any $A$-module. Since the first sequence is exact, $\text{Hom}(E, \text{Hom}(N, P))$ is exact $\implies \text{Hom}(E \otimes N, P)$ is exact $\implies E \otimes N$ is exact.

            If tensoring with $N$ translates all exact sequences into exact sequences, then $N$ is said to be a `flat` $A$-module. This is not true in general, and can be illustrated with an example: consider the exact sequence $0 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{Z}$, where $f(x) = 2x$. Tensoring with $N = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ yields $0 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \otimes N \xrightarrow{f \otimes 1} \mathbb{Z} \otimes N$, which is not exact because, for any $x \otimes y \in \mathbb{Z}$:
            $$(f \otimes 1)(x \otimes y) = 2x \otimes y = x \otimes 2y = 0$$
