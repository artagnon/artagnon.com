Abstract Algebra: Rings

The ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\alpha] = a + b \alpha\) is defined for a complex number \(\alpha\). \(\alpha\) is algebraic if it can be expressed as the roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients; otherwise, it is transcendental.

Elements with multiplicative inverses are terms units of a ring. In \(\mathbb{Z}\), the only units are 1 and -1. In \(\mathbb{R}[x]\), they are nonzero constant polynomials.

The kernel of a homomorphism \(\varphi : R \rightarrow R'\) is defined as:
\[ker(\varphi) = \{a \in R \mid \varphi(a) = 0\}\]
