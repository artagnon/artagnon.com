# artagnon.com

Content and design of [artagnon.com](http://artagnon.com).  Intended
to be used with [clayoven](https://github.com/artagnon/clayoven).

There are some interesting bits of CSS here, as the site targets:

* All modern browsers with a sane screen resolution on Linux and OS X.
* All modern browsers on Android, Kindle Fire, iPhone and iPad.

If you're using something retarded like Internet Explorer on Windows,
I couldn't care less: you're not my intended audience.
