        <h1>On Emacs</h1>
        <p>If you don&#39;t know Emacs Lisp, there&#39;s no point of using Emacs. You&#39;d
          probably be more productive in Vim or [insert favorite proprietary
          editor here].</p>
        <p>Emacs Lisp is probably the most featureless language you can think of;
          it doesn&#39;t even do basic threading and the async stuff is a joke. All
          the major programming language modes are implemented as ad-hoc Elisp
          regexp parsers making bugs impossible to fix. Virtually _everything_
          is implemented in Elisp, because the C code is a gigantic
          unmaintainable mess. This means that all the pretty high-level stuff
          like Magit is shit slow. Good features take ages to propagate to
          upstream, whose reasons are often more political than technical.
          However, it is the only programmable editor in the world, and people
          continue to churn out more and more Elisp. Recent developments like
          MELPA and Marmalade have made packaging and distributing easier than
          ever, and users just need to `M-x package-install` to get their
          favorite packages set up.</p>
        <p>The reason Emacs has been so successful is very simple: there is one
          global environment where all symbols are bound; any package can
          overshadow any existing symbol (variable/function) from anywhere.
          There are no &quot;core&quot; functions versus &quot;library&quot; functions; any package
          can modify very &quot;core&quot; behavior (for instance, find-file) very
          easily*. Ofcourse, this has severe downsides: you can eval bad code
          and screw up your Emacs environment pretty badly (it might even refuse
          to quit); often the only way to recover is to restart Emacs, flushing
          the environment.</p>
        <p>To conclude: learn as much as you can about editors from this monster;
          enjoy tinkering with it. Hopefully, a fresh community will come
          together to build another programmable editor soon.</p>
        <p>* The exception is the few C builtins.
