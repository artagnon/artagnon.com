          Algebraic Toplogy

        <span id="pubdate">Last updated: Fri, 25 Jan 2019</span>
        <p>
          Algebraic Topology is about turning questions about the existence of topological objects to the corresponding algebraic objects. If an algebraic object does not exist, neither does the toplogical one, but since this process leads to information loss, existence of an algebraic object does not imply existence of the corresponding topological object.
        </p>

          Notation: we use \(\cong\) to indicate homomorphism, \(\approx\) to indicate isomorphism, and \(\simeq\) to indicate homotopy equivalence.

        <h2>
          Homotopy
        </h2>
        <p>
          The maps \(f_0, f_1 : X \rightarrow Y\) are said to be homotopic, if there is a homotopy \(f_t\) connecting them; this is denoted as \(f_0 \simeq f_1\). A homotopy \(f : X \rightarrow X\) that gives a deformation retraction of a space \(X\) to space \(A\) has the has the property \(f_t \mid A = \mathbb{1}\) for all \(t\).
        </p>
        <p>
          The notation for two spaces \(X\) and \(Y\) that are homotopy equivalent or have the same homotopy type is \(X \simeq Y\).

        <p>
          An orientable surface of genus \(g\) can be constructed from a polygon with \(4g\) sides. The surface of the torus formed from this construction is termed a 2-cell, while the circles giving it structure are 1-cells.

          Operations on spaces
        </h2>
        <p>
          Wedge sum of two spaces \(X\) and \(Y\), \(X \vee Y\), is defined as quotient of the disjoint union \(X \sqcup Y\) obtained by identifying \(x_0\) and \(y_0\) as a single point. For instance, \(S^1 \vee S^1\) is homeomorphic to the figure &#39;8&#39;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Smash product of two spaces \(X\) and \(Y\), \(X \wedge Y\), is defined as \(X \times Y / (X \vee Y)\).

          Paths and the fundamental group
        </h2>
        <p>
          Homotopy of paths leading from \(x_0\) to \(x_1\) can be written as \(f_t\), where \(f_t(0) = x_0\) and \(f_t(1) = x_1\). Now, \(f_t(s) = f_0(s) + t[f_1(s) - f_0(s)]\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Equivalence class of \(f\) under equivalence relation of homotopy is called homotopy equivalence, and denoted by \([f]\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Composition or product path:
        </p>
        <p>
          \[g . f(s) = \begin{cases} f(2s) & \quad 0 \leq s \leq \frac{1}{2} \\
          g(2s - 1) & \quad \frac{1}{2} \leq s \leq 1 \end{cases}\]
        </p>
        <p>
          Paths that have the same starting and endpoint are called loops, and the point is called the basepoint. The set of all homotopy classes \([f]\), \(f : I \rightarrow X\) with a common basepoint \(x_0\) is called the fundamental group \(\pi_1(X, x_0)\). This is the first in the sequence \(\pi_n(X, x_0)\), where \(I\) is replaced by n-dimensional unit cubes \(I^n\). \(\pi_n(X, x_0)\) is a group with respect to product \([f][g] = [f . g]\).
        </p>
        <p>
          A space \(X\) is said to be simply-connected iff there is a unique homotopy class of paths connecting any two points in \(X\).

          Induced homomorphisms
        </h2>
        <p>
          Induced homomorphisms between fundamental groups arise as a consequence of maps between spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          \(\varphi : (X, x_0) \rightarrow (Y, y_0)\) induces the homomorphism \(\varphi_* : \pi_1(X, x_0) \rightarrow \pi_1(Y, y_0)\) taking loops based at \(x_0\) to loops based at \(y_0\), such that \(\varphi_*[f] = [\varphi f]\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Two basic properties of induced homomorphisms that make the fundamental group a functor:

          van Kampen theorem

        <p>
          The van Kampen theorem gives us a way of computing the fundamental group of spaces which can be decomposed into smaller spaces with known fundamental groups.

        <h2>
          Covering spaces
        </h2>
        <p>
          Covering spaces are a useful tool for computing fundamental groups. A covering space of \(X\) is \(\tilde{X}\) along with the map \(p : \tilde{X} \rightarrow X\): there exists an open cover \(\{U_\alpha\}\), such that, for every \(\alpha\), \(p^{-1}(U_\alpha)\) is a disjoint union of open sets in \(\tilde{X}\), each of which is mapped homeomorphically by \(p\) onto \(\{U_\alpha\}\). \(p\) need not be surjective.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the helix example, we have \(p : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow S^1\), and the open cover can be taken to be disjoint arcs whose union is \(S^1\).
        </p>

          Universal cover: Smallest subgroup \(\pi(B) \leftrightarrow\) biggest covering space of \(B\).

          Homology
        </h2>
        <p>
          \(\pi_i(S^n)\) is \(0\) for \(i \lt n\) and \(\mathbb{Z}\) for \(i = n\). However, higher homotopy groups are difficult to compute, and we use homology groups \(H_n(X)\) instead. For the fundamental group of a circle, \(H_n(S^i) = 0\) for \(i \gt n\).

          The union of all faces of simplices in \(\Delta^n\) is the boundary of \(\Delta^n\), written as \(\partial \Delta^n\). The open simplex \(\mathring{\Delta}^n = \Delta^n - \partial \Delta^n\) is the interior of \(\Delta^n\).
        </p>
        <p>
          A \(\Delta\)-complex on space \(X\) is a collection of maps \(\sigma_\alpha : \Delta^n \rightarrow X\) with each \(n\) dependent on \(\alpha\) such that:

          <li>
            Each restriction of \(\sigma_\alpha\) to a face of \(\Delta^n\) is one of the maps \(\sigma_\beta : \Delta^{n - 1} \rightarrow X\).

          <li>
            \(A \subset X\) is open iff \(\sigma_\alpha^{-1}(A)\) is open in \(\Delta^{n}\) for each \(\sigma_\alpha\).

          Simplicial homology
        </h2>
        <p>
          The task is to define simplicial homology groups of \(\Delta\)-complexes of \(X\). Let \(\Delta_n(X)\) be the free abelian group with basis open n-simplicies \(e_\alpha^n\) of \(X\).
        </p>
        <p>
          To construct an \(n\)-simplex, a cell is attached to the \((n - 1)\)-simplex. The boundary homomorphism \(\partial_n : \Delta_n(X) \rightarrow \Delta_{n - 1}(X)\), is given by:
        </p>
        <p>
          \[\partial_n(\sigma_\alpha) = \sum_i (-1)^i \sigma_\alpha|[v_0, v_1, ... \hat{v_i}, ... v_n]\]

The defect in exactness of this sequence is expressed as the \(n^{th}\) simplicial homology group \(H_n^\Delta = \text{ker } \partial_{n - 1} \text{ / } \text{im } \partial_n\). It follows that \(\text{im } \partial_n \subset \text{ker } \partial_{n - 1}\). Elements of \(H_n\) are cosets of \(\text{im } \partial_n\), and are called homology classes.

          Singular homology
        </h2>
        <p>
          Singular homology may be thought of a special case of simplicial homology: Let \(S(X)\) be the \(\Delta\)-complex with one n-simplex \(\Delta_\alpha^n\) for each singular n-simplex \(\sigma : \Delta^n \rightarrow X\) with \(\Delta_\sigma^n\) attached in the obvious way to \((n - 1)\)-simplices of \(S(X)\) that are restrictions of \(\sigma\) to various \((n - 1)\)-simplices of \(\partial \Delta^n\). Hence, the simplicial group \(H^\Delta_n(S(X))\) is identical to the singular group \(H_n(X)\).
        </p>
        <p>
          For the chain sequence \(C_n \xrightarrow[]{\partial_n} C_{n - 1} \xrightarrow[]{\partial_{n - 1}} ... \xrightarrow[]{\partial_0} C_0\), the homology group is the quotient group \(H_n(X) = \text{ker } \partial_n \text { / } \text{im } \partial_{n + 1}\), with singular n-cycles in the numerator and boundaries in the denominator. In homological algebra, this quotient is termed as defect, as an exact sequence would yield a vacuous quotient group.
        </p>
        <p>
          A singular n-chain can always be written as \(\mathcal{E} = \sum \epsilon_i \sigma_i\) with \(\epsilon_i = \pm 1\); when we compute \(\partial \mathcal{E}\) as a sum of \((n - 1)\) simplices with signs \(\pm 1\), there may be some canceling pairs consisting of identical \((n - 1)\) simplices with opposite sign.
        </p>
        <p>
          Choose a maximal collection of canceling pairs to construct an n-dimensional simplex \(K_\mathcal{E}\) from a disjoint union of n-simplices \(\Delta_i^n\), one for each \(\sigma_i\), by identifying \((n - 1)\)-dimensional faces corresponding to the cancelation pairs. Then, \(\sigma_i\)s induce a map \(K_\mathcal{E} \rightarrow X\). \(K_\mathcal{E}\) is a manifold locally homeomorphic to \(\mathbb{R}^n\) except at subcomplexes of dimension \(\leq (n - 2)\).

          Corresponding to the decomposition of a space to its path-connected components \(X_\alpha\), we have the isomorphism \(H_n(X) \approx \oplus_\alpha H_\alpha(X_\alpha)\). Also, \(H_0(X) \approx \mathbb{Z}\), for path-connected space \(X\). If \(X\) is a point,
          \[H_n(X) \approx \begin{cases} 0 \quad n \gt 0 \\ \mathbb{Z} \quad n = 0 \end{cases}\]

        </p>
        <p>
          \[... \rightarrow H_n(A) \xrightarrow[]{i_*} H_n(B) \xrightarrow[]{j_*} H_n(X, A) \xrightarrow[]{\partial} H_{n - 1}(A) \rightarrow ...\]
        </p>
        <p>
          where \(H_n(A)\) denotes the homology group \(\text{ker } \partial \text { / } \text{im } \partial\) at \(A_n\), with \(H_n(B), H_n(X, A)\) defined similarly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The description of the boundary map \(\partial : H_n(X, A) \rightarrow H_{n - 1}(A)\) is: if class \([\alpha] \in H_n(X, A)\) is represented by a relative cycle \(\alpha\), then \(\partial [\alpha]\) is the class of \(\partial \alpha\ \in H_{n - 1}(A)\).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the l.e.s of homology pairs \((D^n, \partial D^n)\), \(H_i(D^n, \partial D^n) \xrightarrow[]{\partial} \tilde{H}_i(S^{n - 1})\) are isomorphisms for all \(i \gt 0\). Thus,
        </p>
        <p>
          \[H_i(D^n, \partial D^n) \approx \begin{cases} \mathbb{Z} \quad i = n \\ 0 \quad i \neq n \end{cases}\]
