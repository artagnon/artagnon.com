          Abstract Algebra: Rings
        </h1>
        <span id="pubdate">Last updated: Fri, 9 Nov 2018</span>
        <p>
          The ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\alpha] = a + b \alpha\) is defined for a complex number \(\alpha\). \(\alpha\) is algebraic if it can be expressed as the roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients; otherwise, it is transcendental.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elements with multiplicative inverses are terms units of a ring. In \(\mathbb{Z}\), the only units are 1 and -1. In \(\mathbb{R}[x]\), they are nonzero constant polynomials.
        </p>
        <p>
          The kernel of a homomorphism \(\varphi : R \to R&#39;\) is defined as:
          \[ker(\varphi) = \{a \in R \mid \varphi(a) = 0\}\]
        </p>
        <p>
          Closure under multiplication is formalized by a subset \(I \subset R\), the ideal \(I\) of \(R\), such that:
        </p>
        <ul class="ulitems">
          <li>
            \(I\) is a subgroup of \(R^{+}\)
          </li>
          <li>
            \(a \in I\) and \(r \in I\) implies \(ra \in I\)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Any ring with \(\text{ker } \varphi = 0\) has characteristic \(0\). Otherwise characteristic is \(n\) where \(1 + 1 + ... \text{ (n times)} = 0\). \(\mathbb{R}\), \(\mathbb{C}\), and \(\mathbb{Z}\) have characteristic \(0\), while \(\mathbb{F}_P\) has characteristic \(P\).
        </p>
        <h2>
          Homomorphisms
        </h2>
        <p>
          Let \(\pi : R \to \overline{R}\) be a homomorphism, such that \(\overline{R} = R + I\) are the set of cosets. Then \(\text{ker } \pi = I\).
        </p>
        <p>
          For \(\varphi: R \to R&#39;\), \(\varphi / \text{ker } \varphi \cong \text{im } \varphi\). Moreover, there is a bijective correspondence between ideals of \(R\), and those of \(R&#39;\).
        </p>
        <h2>
          Adjunction of elements
        </h2>
        <p>
          Notation: \(\mathbb{R}[\alpha]\) = ring obtained by adjoining \(\alpha\) to the ring \(\mathbb{R}\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Let \(\mathbb{R}[x]\) denote the polynomial ring generated by \(\mathbb{R}\) and \(x\). By adjoining the solution of \(x^{2} + 1 = 0\) to the ring \(\mathbb{R}\), we get the isomorphism \(\mathbb{C} \cong \mathbb{R}[x]/(x^{2} + 1)\).
        </p>
        <p>
          \(\mathbb{R}[x, y]\) can be viewed as a polynomial in \(y\) with coefficients in \(x\): \(\mathbb{R}[x, y] \cong \mathbb{R}[x][y]\) is an isomorphism. For example:
        </p>
        <p>
          \[y^{2} x^{2} + 2yx + 2 = (x^{2}) y^{2} + (2x)y + (2)\]
        </p>
        <h2>
          Fields and integral domains
        </h2>
        <p>
          Integral domains are fields without zerodivisors, and fields have the additional property that every element has a multiplicative inverse.
        </p>
        <p>
          No zerodivisors: satisfies the cancellation law that if \(ab = ac\), then \(b = c\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Fields are characterized by having exactly two ideals: \((0)\) and \((1)\). In integral domains, on the other hand, every ideal is a principal ideal (these ideals generate the whole ring): for instance, in \(\mathbb{Z}\), every prime number is a principal ideal.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Maximal ideals
        </h2>
        <p>
          \(I\) is termed as a maximal ideal if there are no ideals between \(I\) and the whole ring \(A\): in other words, if \(I\) is the maximal ideal, then there is no \(J\) such that \(I \subset J \subset A\). Every maximal ideal \(M\) has the property that \(R / M\) is a field, having exactly two ideals.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Nullstellansatz
        </h2>
        <p>
          Given three functions in two variables:
        </p>
        <p>
          \[f_{1} = x^{2} + y^{2} - 1, f_{2} = x^{2} - y + 1, f_{3} = xy - 1\]
        </p>
        <p>
          We can write \(1 = \sum g_i f_i\), a linear combination with polynomial coefficients.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Algebraic Geometry
        </h2>
        <p>
          The set of solutions of \(ax + by + c = 0\) is a variety, as is a set of points.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two polynomials of degree \(m\) and \(n\) have finitely many points of intersection, and this is known as Bezout bound \(mn\), as long as they have no common factor.
