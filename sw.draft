Software: a bird's eye view

For little toy projects, the most beautiful and elegant language is Ruby, which trades off efficiency of execution. Elixir/Phoenix is a choice if Rails is to be avoided.

Many problems in software are optimization problems in disguise, even if they are traditionally thought of as Operations Research problems. They either fall into the purview of MILP (Mixed-integer linear programming), for which approximate solutions are arrived at using a branch-and-bound method, or discrete optimization, which have exact solutions, and can be modeled in MiniZinc. Many resource allocation and scheduling problems can be modeled beautifully in MiniZinc, although a specialized implementation is necessary to go to production. Even in compilers, almost all loop optimizations can be handled by the Barvinok, a solver over pure affine transformations on mathematical sets and maps.

On the subject of compiler optimizations, LLVM includes a vast number of middle-end transformations.
