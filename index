Ramkumar Ramachandra

I'm a software engineer who loves to work on open source software;
most significantly, I've been contributing to git since January 2010
[1]. I'm currently a student at Columbia University, and will graduate
soon.

Things I like: emacs, ruby, power metal, and fish curry.

See also:

  GitHub [2] for all my personal projects and forks of various
  projects.  I tend to be very active.

  Twitter [3] for immediate thoughts.  I tweet upto three or five
  times a day, but there are days when I don't tweet at all.
