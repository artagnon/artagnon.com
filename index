I write code to make my programming experience more enjoyable â€“
predictably, this centres around git.git.  I also study philosophy for
fun.

I like emacs, ruby, Gentle Giant, and fish.

See also:

  GitHub [1] for all my personal projects and forks of various
  projects.  I tend to be very active.

  Twitter [2] for immediate thoughts.  I usually post three or five
  times a day, but there are days when I don't post at all.
