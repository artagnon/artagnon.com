Ramkumar Ramachandra

I'm an amateur Linux kernel hacker who has been contributing to git
since January 2010 [1]. I'm employed by various organizations at
various points in time, but always hack on open source projects for
fun everywhere.

Things I like: emacs, ruby, power metal, and fish curry.

See also:

  GitHub [2] for all my personal projects and forks of various
  projects.  I tend to be very active.

  Twitter [3] for immediate thoughts.  I usually post three or five
  times a day, but there are days when I don't post at all.
