Existence in space-time and a strong sleeve.  Uniquification through stronger cryptography.  Founding principles: Precision, elegance, and beauty.

For instances of non-commutative rings, there's no need to look further than matrices over \(R\), the field of real numbers.

Another instance of non-commutative algebra can be found in Quarternions, that have different properties when cycling
clockwise and counter-clockwise.
