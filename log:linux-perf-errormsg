linux: improve perf error messages

Currently, execution of 'perf trace' reports the following cryptic
message to the user:

    $ perf trace
    Couldn't read the raw_syscalls tracepoints information!

Typically this happens because the user does not have permissions to
read the debugfs filesystem. Also handle the case when the kernel was
not compiled with debugfs support or when it isn't mounted.

Now, the tool prints detailed error messages:

    $ perf trace
    Error:  Unable to find debugfs
    Hint:   Was your kernel was compiled with debugfs support?
    Hint:   Is the debugfs filesystem mounted?
    Hint:   Try 'sudo mount -t debugfs nodev /sys/kernel/debug'

    $ perf trace
    Error:  No permissions to read $debugfs/tracing/events/raw_syscalls
    Hint:   Try 'sudo mount -o remount,mode=755 /sys/kernel/debug/'
