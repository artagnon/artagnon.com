          What a wonderful device for reading and writing! The reMarkable is as close to paper as it gets; no distractions, and no anti-features like search. Certain things are proprietary, but easy to reverse-engineer: it's great to hack on as a result. It has an ample 6~7 GiB of storage, and a [command-line interface](https://github.com/juruen/rmapi) to their native cloud. You can export your handwriting to [SVG](https://github.com/ax3l/lines-are-beautiful) or to plain text, using their fantastic OCR technology. However, it's a device that targets a very niche audience: a large segment of the population would be much happier with a general-purpose device like the iPad or Surface; people who read novels would get a Kobo, and designers would get a Wacom. The rM is for mathematicians, scientists, and (probably) journalists; the flood of negative reviews can be explained away by this simple fact.

          Immediately after unboxing, I attempted to bulk-upload my books and papers to their native cloud, and was annoyed that the existing annotations in my PDFs were erased. Another source of initial disappointment was that their cloud was slow and glitchy compared to industry-standard solutions like Dropbox, and I decided that they made a bad decision by going with their own cloud instead of just connecting to Dropbox. A prospective-buyer-friend was against using any cloud service, which led me to poke around and find that you can opt-out of the cloud altogether and transfer files via the provided USB cable. I further discovered that rM uses mostly GPLv3 software, and that I could ssh into the device. The OCR is great, but I didn't quite understand the utility, as you only have the option to email the notes after running the OCR; I was having a hard time imagining someone who would prefer hand-writing an email over typing it out.

          The proprietary bits are `xochitl` (the main interface), the cloud API, and the `.rM` file format. All three items have been reverse-engineered, and the community is [thriving](https://remarkablewiki.com); [third-party apps](https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable) are starting to pop up. Along with each PDF, rM stores the associated metadata like current-page in JSON files, and brush strokes in a beautifully simple binary format (the `.rM`). I'm glad they didn't choose to store annotations directly in the PDF; it would have been a nightmare rewriting and uploading the entire PDF file on each save, and having to deal with binary-merge issues. I have extensive experience using PDF Expert on my iPad to know that it's a bad idea to save annotations in-file. Converting existing annotations in PDFs to brush strokes should be doable, but I decided that it wasn't worth the effort.

          Within a few days, I realized that the native cloud was a good idea, because they built their own elegant cloud API, in line with their overall design philosophy. Other than for the intial bulk-transfer, their cloud works quite well: you only ever upload/download one PDF or a few brush strokes at a time thereafter. The main utility of the OCR wasn't to write email to other people, but serves as a replacement for a physical diary; I was very skeptical at first, because I love using my Lamy fountain pen to write in my diary, but the writing experience on the rM is on par.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, rM is cutting-edge technology with a niche audience. The build-quality of the tablet, pencil, and folio are worth the €600.
