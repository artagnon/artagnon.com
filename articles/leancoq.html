          Both Lean and Coq are proof assistants based on pCIC. Here, we argue that what sets them apart are, in essence, cultural differences.

          Lean has much lower startup-cost for pure mathematicians, since its built-in features and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib">math library</a> are great for doing undergraduate-level group theory &amp; topology, masters-level commutative algebra &amp; category theory, but it plateaus quickly thereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lean seems to have taken a top-down approach, by focusing on writing real proofs as quickly as possible, without compromising on <a href="https://github.com/digama0/lean-type-theory/releases/download/v1.0/main.pdf">soundness</a>. There are three axioms in Lean: <mark>propositional extensionality</mark>, <mark>quotient soundness</mark>, and <mark>choice</mark>; however, these don't block computation, since computation is done in a VM. They do, however, break good type theoretic properties like <mark>strong normalization</mark>, <mark>subject reduction</mark>, and <mark>canonicity</mark> — this was a conscious design choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coq, on the other hand, has always been very particular about sound type theoretic foundations. The recent <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~sozeau/research/publications/drafts/Coq_Coq_Correct.pdf">"Coq Coq Correct!"</a> formalizes the Coq engine proving metatheoretic properties about it, in Coq, and <a href="https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT">HoTT</a> is being actively developed to fix many of Coq's issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working mathematicians have only just started using software for their work, and they often rely on unverified (and sometimes proprietary) tools like magma, sage, and mathematica. Lean is a big step-up, and the good type theoretic properties preserved by Coq don't seem as important to them.
        </p>
        <hr class="ellipses" />
        <p>
          Lean supports both constructive and classical reasoning, but quotienting in Coq is painful due to <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psztxa/talks/types-17-hell.pdf">"setoid-hell"</a>; something that would be fixed when types are modeled as $\infty$-groupoids instead of setoids, as in the HoTT line of work.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/tutorial/Zmod37.lean">Quotient-reasoning</a> makes formalizing commutative algebra painless, and it's baked into the Lean kernel. However, quotients are tricky to implement without breaking certain metatheoretic properties that Coq'ers cherish; nevertheless, there is an <a href="https://math-comp.github.io/htmldoc/mathcomp.ssreflect.generic_quotient.html">implementation</a> in Coq's <a href="https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp">math-comp</a>, albeit, without a reduction rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lean's <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/structures_and_records.html#inheritance">inheritance</a> is another good feature; it disallows diamond-inheritance, and seems like a bit of a hack, but Coq is definitely missing some form of a well-thought-out ad-hoc polymorphism.
        </p>
        <hr class="ellipses" />
        <p>
          Category theory in Lean has not been <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/theories/category_theory.md">developed</a> with higher categories in mind; I'm not sure how one would define $\infty$-categories, since universes are explicit, and since there are no coinductive types: Coq's cumulativity seems to have been a better design choice.
        </p>
        <hr class="ellipses" />
        <p>
          One would think that Lean is an engineering feat, since it's written in C++: Coq's math-comp (90k loc) compares to Lean's mathlib (150k loc); math-comp builds in under ten minutes, while mathlib takes over thirty minutes to build! Indeed, due to their design decision to use a VM for computations, computation happens at a speed comparable to Python-bytecode evaluation — they seem to be overhauling this in Lean4 though, by compiling Lean code down to C before execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reason for the relative slowness of Lean is that they do a lot of automation under the hood, figuring out, for instance, that when the user writes $X \times Y$, $X$ and $Y$ are topogical spaces, and that $\times$ here means product topology.
