        <h1>Fairness in justice</h1>
        <pre class="emailquote level-1">&gt; &quot;In a situation where prosecuting N guilty people implies prosecuting
&gt; one innocent person, it is in the better interest of the society to
&gt; prosecute those (N + 1) people&quot; is true for sufficiently large values
&gt; of N.</pre>
        <p>This line of thinking is very utilitarian.  Utilitarianism has been
          shown to have many deep problems, especially when applying it to
          something as sensitive as administering justice.  Most modern justice
          systems are based on the idea of justice as fairness (ref: Rawls&#39; A
          Theory of Justice).  While it is true that we don&#39;t need to have some
          transcendental ideal for administering justice, or a binary evaluation
          of whether it was administered (ref: Sen&#39;s The Idea of Justice),
          fairness is always a guiding principle.
